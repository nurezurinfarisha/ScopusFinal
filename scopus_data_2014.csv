Moreover, there is substantial evidence of investor over-optimism to negative and positive events. The efficient market hypothesis is rejected for all currencies. Contrary to prior studies, currencies of emerging markets do not overreact more than those of the developed markets. The magnitude effect is also not supported. On an aggregate basis, the currency market tends to overreact which implies that the market is not efficient.","Business and International Management, Accounting","Universiti Sains Malaysia","Minden","Malaysia"

Overall, the extent of financial ratios disclosure has significantly increased from 12.2 per cent to 15.0 per cent. The highest level of financial ratios disclosure is for the sub-categories of Profitability, Cash Flow and Share Market Measures, whereas there is less information reported for Capital Structure and Liquidity ratios. Further, the analysis shows that the institutional ownership negatively influences the financial ratios disclosure for 2001; and foreign ownership is positively associated with financial ratios disclosure in 2006. Interestingly, family ownership appears to have no significant influence on the disclosure in either period. Ownership concentration, on the other hand has a positive association with financial ratios disclosure in 2001; this is the opposite direction than hypothesised. In addition, the corporate governance attributes have also influenced the financial ratios disclosure in 2001. As for control variables, firm size and profitability are found to have a positive relationship with financial ratios disclosure for both years. These findings provide evidence that the attributes of ownership structure and the implementation of sound corporate governance reduce the information asymmetry between management and stakeholders and therefore, further enhance transparency.","Business and International Management, Accounting","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The results of this analysis are then used to identify the impact of OBS activities and risk exposures on cost and profit efficiencies using a Tobit regression. Bank insolvency risk (as measured by z-scores) is positively related to profit efficiency, while interest sensitivity, size, equity to total assets and OBS exposures all impact on cost efficiency. The analysis of the impact of input and output slacks illustrates that in around 1 in 5 cases banks’ cost efficiency can be improved by adjusting the former variables, whereas in only around 1 in 100 cases a similar outcome is possible for profit efficiency.","Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Universiti Malaya","Kuala Lumpur","Malaysia"

This study employs content analysis of Agenda Setting of Iraq image in Malaysian English newspapers indicated that NSTP and the Star. In total, 535 articles and news stories were obtained from three periods before, during and after the occupation of Iraq. Findings showed that the Agenda Setting for NSTP focused on the issue of “The Malaysia’s policy towards Iraq”, “The US policy and the occupation of Iraq” and “The impact of war on Malaysia”. While, the Star focused on “Iraq’s needs and suffering”. In summary, the newspapers seem to take great care in transmitting images of other countries particularly the Islamic country, which could affect Malaysia and its neighbors politically, economically and socially. Thus it can be concluded that the media’s ownership position plays vital role in shaping countries image in media coverage. The current study indicated that the positive and neutral image of Iraq in NSTP are considered important to the Malaysian government to advance its domestic and foreign policies to Malaysians, and also due to its political and economic interests with Iraq which is a Muslim country. Contrarily, the Star seemed to oppose government policies but this opposition is marginal and issue specific in nature depending upon the involvement of Malaysia interests and intensity of the government media differences on those issues.","Arts and Humanities (all), Social Sciences (all), Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","Ministry Of Science and Technology, Baghdad | Universiti Utara Malaysia","Baghdad | Sintok","Iraq | Malaysia"

In software testing field, there have been diverse automated methods for test data generation. Unfortunately, APA seldom adopts these methods. Merely limited studies have attempted to integrate APA and test data generation to include more useful features and to provide a precise and thorough quality of program testing. Thus, we propose a framework of test data generation so-called FaSt-Gen to cover both the functional and structural testing of a program for APA. It aims to assist the lecturers of programming courses to furnish an adequate set of test data to assess students' programming solutions regardless of having the concrete expertise in the particular knowledge of test cases design. FaSt-Gen integrates the positive and negative testing criteria (or reliable and valid test adequacy criteria) to derive desired test data and test set schema. The findings from the conducted experiment depict that FaSt-Gen improves the reliability and validity test data adequacy in programming assessments.","Software","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The consequences of obesity on numerous aspects of life are thoroughly explored in the existing literature. For instance, evidence shows that obesity is linked to incidences of diseases such as heart disease, type-2 diabetes, and some cancers, as well as psychosocial problems. To respond to the increasing trends in the UK, in 2008 the government set a target to reverse the prevalence of obesity (POB) back to 2000 levels by 2020. This paper will outline the application of system dynamics (SD) optimization to simulate the effect of changes in the eating behavior of British children (aged 2 to 15 years) on weight and obesity. This study also will identify how long it will take to achieve the government's target. This paper proposed a simulation model called Intervention Childhood Obesity Dynamics (ICOD) by focusing the interrelations between various strands of knowledge in one complex human weight regulation system. The model offers distinct insights into the dynamics by capturing the complex interdependencies from the causal loop and feedback structure, with the intention to better understand how eating behaviors influence children's weight, body mass index (BMI), and POB measurement. This study proposed a set of equations that are revised from the original (baseline) equations. The new functions are constructed using a RAMP function of linear decrement in portion size and number of meal variables from 2013 until 2020 in order to achieve the 2020 desired target. Findings from the optimization analysis revealed that the 2020 target won't be achieved until 2026 at the earliest, six years late. Thus, the model suggested that a longer period may be needed to significantly reduce obesity in this population.","Multidisciplinary","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This study aims to determine the association between gender and gender differences in the perceived use of Metacognitive Awareness Reading Strategies (Global, Problem-Solving & Support Reading strategies) among Biology students in a Matriculation College situated in State of Kedah, Malaysia. In this study, 318 Matriculation College students participated, in which 97 male students and 221 female students studied Biology as one of the subjects. They rated their own perceived use level of Metacognitive Awareness Reading Strategies using Metacognitive Awareness of Reading Strategies Inventory (MARSI) adapted from Mokhtari and Reichard (2002). The findings show that female students use Metacognitive Awareness Reading Strategies more frequently compared to male students while reading academic materials. The findings show that students apply problem-solving strategies the most compared to the other metacognitive reading strategies, while the least used strategy is the global reading strategy. However, there are no significant difference between males and females for both these strategies. In comparison, male and female students differ in the application of Support Reading Strategies, where more females use the strategies compared to males. Students themselves should learn Metacognitive Awareness Reading Strategies and apply them in their Biology reading. Global reading strategies, too, should be given more attention as this is the least used strategy. A more balanced use of all the metacognitive strategies would help students to improve their level of achievement as each strategy has its own strengths. Future research should investigate the ways to nurture metacognitive skills in reading as one of the strategies to improve reading comprehension and future performance in Biology.","Arts and Humanities (all), Social Sciences (all), Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The spread of the luxury model as suggested by Chadha and Husband (2006) helps to better understand the spread of luxury culture among Asian societies. In the past, many studies have suggested that conspicuous and luxury concepts are related to each other. By examining the conspicuous motivation among consumers, the authors hope to explain why people are motivated to engage with luxury consumption from a cultural theoretical lens, particularly in Asian countries.

Previous studies have clearly stated that the study of religion's influence on consumer behavior is still under-researched (Lindridge, 2005; Mokhlis, 2009, 2010). The premise lies in the view that culture is a way of life, and thus, the authors explore whether or not that suggests the same for religion, and if it is, how does religion predict the conspicuous behavior of people towards the purchase of luxury goods? In specific, the authors are interested in exploring the level and intensity of religiosity on conspicuous consumption. Therefore, it is significant to study ""religiosity"" as one of the predictive factors of a consumerism culture that may help explain why people engage in conspicuous consumption. The chapter provides a concluding remark by highlighting the practical aspects on domestic or international marketers who wish to market their luxury products in Malaysia.","Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all), Business, Management and Accounting (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The main objective of this study was to add to limited evidence related to how and in what ways technology and knowledge are diffused. Specifically, it attempts to contribute to the FDI spillover literature by exploring the channels through which technology and knowledge could be transferred to the host country. In doing so, the authors had employed an in-depth case study method in order to generate a deeper understanding of the significance of the assistance provided by MNCs and that this method would prove an effective strategy in generating a large volume of very meaningful data. The study has identified that technology is diffused from MNCs to local suppliers through the production process, technical consultation and production facilities. Local suppliers enhance their innovative capacity through these linkages. The findings not only provide benefit to the academic circle but also to local businesses, especially small and medium industries, as well as policy makers.

The study uses a sample of 1023 directors from 134 companies on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia (Malaysian Bourse) in year 2008. The results of the study show that the incidence of multiple directorships is low. Independent directors are found to have more multiple directorships. Directors with multiple directorships are older directors, have less director ownerships and are on boards with a high fraction of independent directors. Based on the 75% cut-off for the percentage of meetings' attendance, the logistic regression suggests that no agency cost is associated with multiple directorships. However, the tendency to be absent from board meetings is associated with the high number of board meetings whilst the tendency to attend more board meetings is associated with the increase in age, tenure, and director ownership.","Business and International Management, Accounting, Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Machine loading - one of the important components of capacity planning is known for its complexity that encompasses various types of flexibilities pertaining to part selection, machine and operation assignment along with constraints. Various studies are done to balance the productivity and flexibility in flexible manufacturing system (FMS). From the literature, researchers have developed many approaches to reach a suitable balance of exploration (global improvement) and exploitation (local improvement). We adopt a hybrid of population approaches; hybrid constraint-chromosome genetic algorithm and harmony search algorithm (H-CCGaHs), to solve this problem that aims at mapping a feasible solution to the domain problem. The objectives are to minimize the system unbalance as well as to increase the throughput while satisfying the constraints such as machine time availability and tool slots. The proposed algorithm is tested for its performance on 10 sample problems available in FMS literature and compared with existing solution approaches.","Software, Theoretical Computer Science, Information Systems, Computational Theory and Mathematics","Universiti Sains Malaysia","Minden","Malaysia"

The adoption of BIM software has proven to be beneficial to the construction organisation in term of design, analysis, construction, operation and data management. The utilization of BIM software would lead to an effective planning and scheduling; encourage collaboration among technical team member and increase overall quality of the project. In recent years, rapid development of Information Communication Technology (ICT) in construction have witness numerous BIM software available in market where each tools offer wide variety of functionality, features and cost. Thus, it is identified that there is a needs to aid decision making for construction organization in order to select appropriate BIM software to a particular project needs. This paper discusses the some aspect of BIM, Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) and Decision Support System (DSS) as decision tools in BIM selection. A documental analysis was performed to gather information regarding the DSS building block and data needed to support the decision model development. Literature suggests that software selection criteria can be categorize under technical, managerial and cost consideration. 24 distinct criteria with 44 alternatives (from 11 vendors) are presented in the paper. In addition, a conceptual model of decision hierarchy is illustrates to be embedded in the DSS prototype. It is also anticipated that the work demonstrated in this paper may improve the development of DSS for BIM software selection as it is vital to increase productivity, construction project throughout building lifecycle.","Building and Construction","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Recently, a class of one-step exponential-rational methods (ERMs) was discovered. Analyses showed that all ERMs are exponentially-fitted, hence implying L-stability. Several numerical experiments showed that ERMs are more accurate than existing rational methods in solving general initial value problem. However, ERMs have two weaknesses: every ERM is non-uniquely defined and may return complex values. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to modify the original ERMs so that these weaknesses will be overcome. This study discusses the generalizations of the modified ERMs and the theoretical analyses involved such as consistency, stability and convergence. Numerical experiments showed that the modified ERMs and the original ERMs are found to have comparable accuracy; hence modified ERMs are preferable to original ERMs.","Multidisciplinary","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on an annual panel data covering the period from 1985 to 2012, and a simple multiple regression for empirical investigation is used. Both fixed effects and random effects models were used as analytical techniques. Findings: The study reveals that both corruption and inflation rate are negatively related to GDP per capita and are statistically significant. As to the impacts of the control variables i.e., dependency ratio is found to be negative and openness to trade to be statistically significant which shows a positive impact on GDP per capita. Practical implications: The results resoundingly confirmed the importance of good governance, therefore, reducing endemic corruption and controlling inflation needs to be among the foremost factors for consideration for policymakers in adopting and implementing macroeconomic and public policies. In order to be most effective in tackling corruption, it is important to get to the root of the problem. In light of the study findings, it is suggested that corruption need to be put under control and economies be made more open to attain more benefits and accelerate economic growth and development. Originality/value: Explicitly, this study provides some valuable evidence on the linkage between endemic corruption and economic growth in some Asia and the Pacific countries in particular and on developing world in general. Presumably, this is the first inclusive investigation on the subject under the study in the context of Asia and the Pacific countries and will emphatically contribute to the literature as well.","Economics and Econometrics, Social Sciences (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Methods and Materials: The study was a double-blind comparison of MF with D (Diprobase), administered daily from the start of radiation therapy for 5 weeks in patients receiving breast radiation therapy, 40 Gy in 2.67-Gy fractions daily over 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was mean modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) score. Results: Mean RTOG scores were significantly less for MF than for D (P=.046). Maximum RTOG and mean erythema scores were significantly less for MF than for D (P=.018 and P=.012, respectively). The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score was significantly less for MF than for D at weeks 4 and 5 when corrected for Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire scores. Conclusions: MF cream significantly reduces radiation dermatitis when applied to the breast during and after radiation therapy. For the first time, we have shown a significantly beneficial effect on quality of life using a validated instrument (DLQI), for a topical steroid cream. We believe that application of this cream should be the standard of care where radiation dermatitis is expected.","Radiation, Oncology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Cancer Research","Royal Preston Hospital","Preston","United Kingdom"

One of the major issues in delivery of ICT works is unavailability of ICT interface strategy and methodology to be referred by ICT contractors or system integrators involved in construction-based project. The problem arise when interfacing processes are not well understood and coordinated properly especially in large scale construction project which has complex tasks of engineering integration. This research is an “action research” where the root of problem is originated from the workplace area of the researcher. This research will identify the common practice of work integration between ICT and engineering, interfacing processes and type of ICT works involved in a construction-based project experienced and managed by KLIA Consultancy Services Sdn Bhd (KLIACS). Qualitative method will be applied where two case studies will be conducted in order to gain information of ICT plan and method used during the project implementation. The expected result of this research would be the creation of an ICT work interface strategy which able to provide interface planning and framework for delivering ICT works involved in construction-based project. It is anticipated that the result would be able to contribute to the improvement of the ICT works interface and project integration as well as the enhancement of the project quality management system of KLIACS.

There are many cause of fire and it might get worse if there is no precaution been taken. Therefore it is vital for us to take precaution acts to prevent or at least to reduce the risk of fire. One of the prevention methods is known as crowd management. It is crucial for us to have a very good crowd management in assembly occupancies such as hotels, cinemas and apartments as well. The main idea in crowd management is that how you direct the building occupants in a building into a smooth flow from the affected area to the safe area. Crowd management consists of two major areas which are human psychology and also design involving fire safety in building. Human psychology will involves with human behaviors in fire and the factors that influence them to behave such alike.

In response to this challenge, and consistent with the requirements of the construction industry to perform better in terms of innovation and productivity, this paper aims to propose a framework for enabling the partnering process which meets the needs of different organizational culture within the Malaysian construction industry. The framework is based on the findings from a recent postgraduate study on the engagement of Malaysian construction firms in partnering practices. The findings concluded that although the government has made the effort in introducing partnering, the industry has not fully embraced this method due to dissimilarities in organizational culture among firms involved and several partnering enablers are yet to be present in the industry.","Management of Technology and Innovation, Computer Science (all)","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Later due to the sigma associate with oil palm plantations jobs viz., dirty, dangerous and distance, the Indians and Chinese workers moved away from the oil palm work and they were replaced by Indonesians and Philippines. These foreign workers whom having the legal and illegal status under enforcement in Malaysia, have been living in remotely located inhabitations engaging in ‘dirty, dangerous and distance’ wise oil palm plantations. Though the larger oil palm plantation companies ensure minimum living and working conditions for the foreign workers, vastly located small holding plantations never follow such minimum and fair working environment. These conditions to be correlated with the term “precarious working conditions’ in small holding oil palm plantations. Due to lack of availability of the locals to engage in oil palm work, the plantations have to depend on foreign workers do all these ‘dirty, dangerous and distance’ workers in oil palm plantations. Except a few literature available from Amnesty international and local NGOs, there is less evidence to prove the existence of such exploitative working conditions in oil palm plantations.

Developing countries are striving to compete in the global intense market, including Malaysia, and for that reason, this key industry needs to maintain and boost local capabilities for the economic strengthen and stability. As the technological capability (TC) has a strong involvement in the production and operation sectors which are the cornerstones of each manufacturing company, it should be improved and monitored periodically. The nature of a long term commitment of the technological capability creation and accumulation requires a huge considerable effort from a company to realize the effects of TC have on performance measures in every aspect while gaining competitive advantages and sustaining commercial success in the local and international market within their operational periods. Based from a resource-based view, it is in congruence that capabilities will promote firms' competitive advantage by improving the performance.

As a result, breast cancer patients may response to different therapeutic options. Currently, difficulties in recognizing the breast cancer types lead to inefficient treatments. Generally, there are two types of breast cancer, known as malignant and benign. Therefore it is necessary to devise a clinically meaningful classification of the disease that can accurately classify breast cancer tissues into relevant classes. This study aims to classify breast cancer lesions which have been obtained from fine needle aspiration (FNA) procedure using random forest. Random forest is a classifier built based on the combination of decision trees and has been identified to perform well in comparison to other machine learning techniques. This method has been tested on approximately 700 data, which consists of 458 instances from benign cases and 241 instances belong to malignant cases. The performance of proposed method is measured based on sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The experimental results show that, random forest achieved sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 70% and accuracy about 72%. Thus, it can be concluded that random forest can accurately classify breast cancer types given a small number of features and it works as a promising tool to differentiate malignant from benign tumor at early stage.","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Signal Processing, Control and Systems Engineering","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Although the algorithm is proven can improve detection performance, it relies on several parameters which need to be defined before mining. In this study, the most appropriate parameter setting for outbreak detection using dendrite cell algorithm is examined. The experiment includes four parameters; the number of cell cycle update, the number of dendrite cell allowed to be in population, weight, and migration threshold value. To achieve that, an anthrax disease outbreak is chosen as a case study. Two artificial anthrax datasets known as WSARE7 and WSARE58 are taken as experiment data. The experiment is measured based on five metrics; detection rate, specificity, false alarm rate, accuracy, and time taken to produce result. Besides that, a comparison is made with Cumulative Sum, Exponentially-weighted Moving Average, and Multi Layer Perceptron. From the experiment, the best parameter setting for anthrax outbreak using dendrite cell algorithm is identified whereby it proven can helps the model to produce a good detection result between detection rate and false alarm rate. Since each outbreak disease carries different outbreak characteristic, the parameter setting for different outbreak might be different.","Information Systems","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Another reason is that organizations do not pay attention to one of the main component of KM which is knowledge sharing. Thus, the objective of this conceptual paper is to explore the impact of organizational culture on knowledge sharing behavior. This paper examines several different cultural dimensions that were initially introduced by Geert Hofstede’s et al., (1990). Years later, in 2010, Hofstede collaborated with an economist--Bob Waisfisz to further explore organizational cultural dimensions in which we find the dimensions can offer theoretical insights to knowledge sharing behaviors among employees in organizations. Each of these dimensional dichotomies has the potential to affect knowledge sharing and KM in different organizational environments.

One major drawback in OFDM communication is peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Mainly because of the nonlinearity of the high power amplifier, these results in high out-of-band radiation, inter-carrier interference, and bit error rate performance degradation. Partial transmit sequences (PTS), an attractive technique of PAPR reduction, provides significant PAPR reduction performance for (OFDM) signals. It essentially involves partitioning the OFDM data frame into disjoint sub-blocks. Adjacent partitioning (AP) scheme can be regarded as the best of the existing partitioning schemes when PAPR reduction performance and cost are considered together. In this paper, we study the impact of the size of PTS partitions on the performance through varying the size of the disjoint sub-blocks partition and comparing the PAPR reduction performance of three well known sub-block partitioning schemes namely Adjacent Partitioning (AP), Interleaved Partitioning (IP) and Pseudorandom Partitioning (PRP).

However, there are only 17% of the graduates who are willing to become entrepreneurs each year. This indicates that students have a lack of intentions to become entrepreneurs. However, there is less research and literature to support the argument that the students do not have entrepreneurial intention. In order to explore the entrepreneurial intention among the Indonesian students graduating universities and business schools from a qualitative study was conducted. The methodology used to develop an appropriate variable for entrepreneurial intention is focused group discussion (FGD), case analysis, interviews and Delphi technique measures the student's entrepreneurial intention. There are 20 experts were willing to take part in this study and the study identified 4 factors that eventually suit the student desire to deal with entrepreneurship.

Even though efficiency study is vital for health care institution in monitoring performance, to date no study has been undertaken to measure technical and scale efficiencies of public hospitals in Kedah specifically. The objectives of this study are to measure technical and scale efficiencies among district public hospitals in the state of Kedah, Malaysia. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique was used in estimating the efficiency score of these hospitals. Data were obtained from nine public hospitals in Kedah for three years from 2008 to 2010. The DEA technique was used on pooled data which consists of 27 decision-making units (DMUs). The input data comprised the number of doctors, nurses and beds while the number of outpatients, inpatients, surgeries and deliveries performed represented the outputs. Of 27 DMUs, 74 per cent were technically efficient which lied on the best-practice frontier. The technical efficiency (TE) score of technical-inefficient hospitals ranged between 0.780 and 0.991 with the average of 0.935 while the score of scale-inefficient hospitals was between 0.832 and 0.992. The average score of 16 scale-inefficient DMUs was 0.938 which implies that, on average, these DMUs were able to reduce 6.25 per cent of their resources while maintaining the same number of output.","Health Policy","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Therefore, the main aim of this study is to identify the commonality of the diverse elements used by the different experts to eliminate their redundancy. A conceptual model of the identified DST core elements was constructed and reviewed by five international experts. The model was then further evaluated by 62 potential DST users. The evaluation on the quality of the model encompassed the following constructs: Perceived Ease of Understanding, Perceived Usefulness, User Satisfaction, and Perceived Semantic Quality. The findings indicated that the respondents perceived the conceptual model as having quality (mean score of 4.936 over a scale of 7.000). T-Test also revealed that there is no significant difference between the perception of those with experience in developing DST and those without experience. This suggests that the conceptual model consisting of the DST core elements, which is the main contribution of the study, could guide digital storytellers in developing digital story.","Media Technology, Computer Science Applications, Computer Networks and Communications, Theoretical Computer Science","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Once the integration seeps deeper into functional levels, the M&A commitment offered at strategic level is faced with operational implementation challenges. The marketing departmental function is usually heavily involved in this integration process. Research on marketing integration in relation to M&As has paid little attention to the process of combining resources from two similar departments, particularly in a cross-border M&A context. Furthermore, existing research does not clearly highlight those factors that contribute to successful marketing integration. Hence, this paper discusses the phenomenon of marketing integration in the cross-border M&A context. Collaboration, interaction, marketing synergy and redeployment of marketing resources are proposed as antecedents to the integration. Drawing from the extant literature, propositions are developed and mechanisms to improve M&A integration performance are elaborated.","Business and International Management, Education, Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Alliance Manchester Business School | LUT University","Manchester | Lappeenranta","United Kingdom | Finland"

Findings – Results indicate intention to be a significant predictor for zakah compliance behavior. Intention is further found to be influenced by both attitude and subjective norm, and it mediates the relationship between both factors with business zakah compliance behavior. Practical implications – As attitude, subjective norm and intention are found to influence business zakah compliance behavior, zakah institutions should give serious attention on these factors to improve their zakah collection in the future.

The algorithms for closed and maximal itemsets mining significantly reduce the volume of rules discovered and complexity associated with the task, but the implications of their use and important differences with respect to the generalization power, precision and recall when used in the classification problem have not been examined. In this paper, we present a systematic evaluation of the association rules discovered from frequent, closed and maximal itemset mining algorithms, combining common data mining and statistical interestingness measures, and outline an appropriate sequence of usage. The experiments are performed using a number of real-world datasets that represent diverse characteristics of data/items, and detailed evaluation of rule sets is provided as a whole and w.r.t individual classes. Empirical results confirm that with a proper combination of data mining and statistical analysis, a large number of non-significant, redundant and contradictive rules can be eliminated while preserving relatively high precision and recall. More importantly, the results reveal the important characteristics and differences between using frequent, closed and maximal itemsets for the classification task, and the effect of incorporating statistical/heuristic measures for optimizing such rule sets. With closed itemset mining already being a preferred choice for complexity and redundancy reduction during rule generation, this study has further confirmed that overall closed itemset based association rules are also of better quality in terms of classification precision and recall, and precision and recall on individual class examples. On the other hand maximal itemset based association rules, that are a subset of closed itemset based rules, show to be insufficient in this regard, and typically will have worse recall and generalization power. Empirical results also show the downfall of using the confidence measure at the start to generate association rules, as typically done within the association rule framework. Removing rules that occur below a certain confidence threshold, will also remove the knowledge of existence of any contradictions in the data to the relatively higher confidence rules, and thus precision can be increased by disregarding contradictive rules prior to application of confidence constraint. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Theoretical Computer Science, Statistics and Probability, Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty, Computational Theory and Mathematics","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

One of the problems encountered by network practitioners is the seamless integration of network components into healthcare delivery. As a multiplexing hospital model, the implementation certainly presents some challenges. The major technical and performance issues involve are as following. The operating parameters should keep aligned to the Quality of Service (QoS) requirement throughout simulation. Bandwidth utilisation of wireless networking is a challenging issue for real-time multimedia transmission. IEEE 802.11 provides relatively lower data rate than wired networks, thus the developer tends to adopt a more compromised solution: either reduce the file size or compress the image packets. Communication performance that varies constantly with the impact of signal strength, traffic load and interference. As stated radio signal senses as a curve and attenuates greatly while metallic object and microwave exist within the active range. To ensure devices do not interfere with other electronic equipments (e.g. heart monitors), assert wireless spectrum has to be managed appropriately. This research paper aims to develop a generic hospital network scenarios using Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) over OPNET Simulation, to evaluate the performance of the integrated network scenario for Intensive Care Units (ICU). This research makes use of computer simulation and discusses various aspects of the network design, so as to discover the performance behaviour pertaining to effect of traffic type, traffic load and network size. In the ICU scenario, the performance of video conference degrades with network size, thus, a QoS-enabled device is recommended to reduce the packet delay and data loss. IEEE 802.11a suits in hospital environment because it mitigates interference on the 2.4GHz band where most wireless devices operate. Experiment examines the effect of signal strength in WLAN. It is convinced that -88dBm is the best signal strength threshold. Although 802.11a generates slightly lower throughput than 802.11g, this issues can be addressed by placing more APs in the service area. It is convinced that 802.11a suits the hospital environments, because it mitigates interference on the popular 2.4GHz band where most wireless devices operate.

One of the problems encountered by network practitioners is the seamless integration of network components into healthcare delivery. A good understanding of the performance of integrated networks is required for efficient design and deployment of such technologies in hospital environments. This research paper discuss on the modelling and evaluation of integrated network scenarios in hospital environments. The impact of traffic types (e.g. data, voice and video), traffic load, network size and signal strength on network performance is investigated by simulation. Three piloted case studies look at client performance in radiology Accident and Emergency (A & E and Intensive Care Unit (ICU)) scenarios. Each scenario reflects the need for various traffic types that end up distinct network behaviours. In the radiology scenario, email and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) traffic is found to perform well for medium-to-large networks. In the A & E scenario, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) traffic is shown to generate very limited jitter and data loss. The performance is aligned with the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.

The crucial step in any PTS system is partitioning of the OFDM frame into disjoint sub-blocks. Adjacent partitioning (AP) is a rather simple partitioning scheme achieving attractive PAPR reduction performance in trade-off between cost and performance. In this paper, Finite Radon Transform (FRAT) is implemented as a modulation technique for data mapping and a comparative analysis of the performance of FRAT is carried out against that of ordinary data mapping techniques such as phase shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The research objective is to find the most appropriate modulation scheme for OFDM system with PTS scheme. In order to perform the comparative analysis, the FRAT as well as PSK and QAM modulation techniques was implemented for the purpose of data mapping. Another dimension for comparative analysis was PTS partition length variability. Adjacent PTS scheme was implemented for both fixed length and variable length partitioning for the aforesaid modulation techniques. The results obtained for all the scenarios were investigated. These modulation schemes were also tested for the case of interleaved PTS scheme. Simulation results with different partitioning scenarios showed that the ordinary mapping for any types of techniques (PSK or QAM) had better PAPR reduction performance compared with FRAT. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

A multi-stage sampling technique is employed to select 600 households of 12 districts in the rural Pattani province and a structured questionnaire is used for data collection. Evidences from descriptive analysis show that the type of risks faced by households in rural Pattani province are job loss, reduction of salary, household member died, household members who work have accident, marital problem and infection of crops/livestock. In addition, result from the regression analysis suggests that job loss, household member died and marital problem have significant negative effects on the households' income. The result suggests that job loss has adverse impact on households' income. The implication of this is that the living standard of household will continue to deteriorate as large proportion of them could either not find job or lost their jobs. Therefore, an important policy suggestion is that government should formulate a policy that considers the creation of employment especially for the poor households with low-income particularly in the rural area. Also, government should provide an appropriate social security benefits program on which the affected population can rely on in case of problem such as sickness/accident/death of the household members.

It is found that GDP, real exchange rate, financial development, corporate income tax, macroeconomic uncertainty and social uncertainty factors significantly affect inward FDI in E&E sector in Malaysia. Empirical results indicate that GDP, real exchange rate, financial development and macroeconomic uncertainty are positively related to inward FDI in E&E sector in the long run. However, corporate income tax and social uncertainty have a negative impact on inward FDI in E&E sector. Furthermore, the Granger causality results also indicate that all explanatory variables Granger-cause FDI in the long-run, but in the short-run only macroeconomic and social uncertainties Granger-cause FDI. The impact of social uncertainty is found to be greater than macroeconomic uncertainty. Thus, foreign investors in E&E sector seem to be more concern about the level of social security and safety when choosing their investment destination.","Economics and Econometrics","Universiti Sains Malaysia","Minden","Malaysia"

Different traffic types are used, and Simulation results show that in video traffic, FLS and EXP algorithms provide a higher system throughput compared to other algorithms while keeping the delay and packet loss ratio small. However, in the case of best-effort traffic, results show a high delay and PLR with low throughput. The main contribution of this paper is to determine the appropriate downlink scheduling algorithm for VOIP, video, and best-effort traffics in 3GPP LTE.","Computer Science (miscellaneous), Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Drawing on the theory of planned behaviour, this research developed an integrated model to explain dietary supplement consumption, by incorporating a comprehensive set of consumer characteristics. Data were collected using a cross-sectional survey of 438 undergraduate students in Malaysia. Structural equation modelling was used to assess the hypothesised relationships. Findings reveal that health consciousness, health motivation and health value account for significant additional variance, suggesting the particular relevance of these consumer characteristics, in addition to social cognitive factors, in explaining dietary supplement use.

Previous studies have clearly stated that the study of religion's influence on consumer behavior is still under-researched (Lindridge, 2005; Mokhlis, 2009, 2010). The premise lies in the view that culture is a way of life, and thus, the authors explore whether or not that suggests the same for religion, and if it is, how does religion predict the conspicuous behavior of people towards the purchase of luxury goods? In specific, the authors are interested in exploring the level and intensity of religiosity on conspicuous consumption. Therefore, it is significant to study ""religiosity"" as one of the predictive factors of a consumerism culture that may help explain why people engage in conspicuous consumption. The chapter provides a concluding remark by highlighting the practical aspects on domestic or international marketers who wish to market their luxury products in Malaysia.","Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all), Business, Management and Accounting (all), Arts and Humanities (all), Social Sciences (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

To examine the factors, two firms were selected based on their market presence, consumer familiarity, and product affordability. In total, 577 questionnaires were distributed to Muslim university students, and the results were validated through Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) approach. Three factors were found to be significant in predicting the willingness to boycott; they were self-enhancement, perceived egregious behavior, and country image. This chapter addresses boycott motivations from the context of Malaysian Muslims quantitatively, based on an international issue strongly related to Muslims.

However the existing WiMAX architecture does not provide sufficient QoS. In this regard, a Distributed Master-Slave Model was developed to improve QoS with respect to throughput in the Fixed WiMAX Network in order to evaluate the throughput performance for the delivery of better services to the end users.

Malaysia has witnessed a dazzling growth of 10.06% of its production recently from 4.05 million hectares in 2005 in an area of 54,000 hectares. Further, the production has enlarged from 94,000 tons in 1960 to 15 million tons in 2005, or by almost 160 times within 45 years-this represents a compound annual growth of 11.93% per year. The oil palm industry is labor intensive, since there is less adoption of mechanization in the field operations. Production of agriculture is usually associated with high incidence of ergonomic injuries, mainly during rigorous manual labor and throughout harvesting. Although scientific explanations are available, very less research was conducted to identify and fix variables that are closely related to ergonomics issues of workers in oil palm plantations related to workers absconding and disengagement from work. Field visits were conducted in the present study, to get an insight into the causal factors of ergonomics in relation to workers intention to abscond and disengagement in oil palm plantations was further congregated into.

However, because an auditor's state of mind is difficult to observe, stakeholders of audit quality generally evaluate the auditor's appearance of objectivity by considering whether or not auditors are able to avoid circumstances that impair Audit Independence (AI). In this regard, most AI researches focus on examining factors influencing perceived audit independence (PAI) and not what actually constitutes PAI and how it can be measured. This paper proposes that PAI can be measured by assessing how auditors use safeguards to manage AI threats to acceptable levels that may no longer compromise AI.

To examine the level of acceptance of this technology, the UTAUT (Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology) Model is used to infer individual students' technology acceptance by explaining the variants in Behavior Intention (BI). This study is conducted on 65 postgraduate students pursuing their study at UUM. The students are all studying the same course and they are exposed to the application of LMS known as 'Moodle UUM Learning Zone'. A set of questionnaire, in the UTAUT Model which is developed by Venkatesh et al. (2003), is used to collect data which is then descriptively analyzed by using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 20 and SmartPLS 2.0. The findings of the study found that Performance Expectancy (PE) (β=0.418, p<0.01), Social Influence (SI) (β=0.238, p<0.01) and Facilitating Conditions (FC) (β=0.120, p<0.01) have positive influence towards 'Behavioral Intention' (BI). The value R2 = 0.520 showed that 52.0% of the variants in the application of Learning zone can be explained by Behavioral Intention (BI). Consequently, the result related to moderator influence in terms of gender showed that all the four UTAUT Model constructs failed to reject HO5. The results also showed that moderator influence in terms of gender with PE, EE, SI and FC does not have significant positive influence towards BI. The findings of this study which are hoped to help encourage instructors and students to use this technology in their learning and teaching processes, have proven that LMS 'Moodle' is beneficial and effective for learning and teaching processes.","Arts and Humanities (all), Social Sciences (all), Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

As “offer and acceptance” or “ījāb and qabūl” (i.e.ṣīghah) is, according to the vast majority of scholars, an absolute requirement of exchange contracts and can be executed only after the seller possesses the contracted item. Pre-signing in normal circumstances has been seen as either a promise from one party to purchase or to sell, or as an execution of contract without proper ownership by contracting parties. Hence, the study is integral in order to analyse the permissibility of considering pre-signing as offer and acceptance. Furthermore, it is assumed that any non-compliance issues in the execution of a contract will affect its validity. Therefore, this study aims to explain the Sharīʿah view on the sequence of contract execution in Islamic banking products, and the Islamic banks’ practices in executing contracts in vehicle financing, house financing and personal financing. The paper applies the qualitative research method comprising of document analyses, fiqh muqāran and interviews with the stakeholders. This paper suggests that “offer and acceptance” should be done in a proper manner as described by Islamic jurists and that modern technology, especially communication technology, should be used to overcome pre-signing needs. In a nutshell, this study contributes in sharpening the practices of Islamic banks to comply with contractual sequence as required by Islamic law.","Development, Finance, Economics and Econometrics","UUM Islamic Business School","Sintok","Malaysia"

Compared to conventional investors who are not restricted in their choice of funds, Islamic investors are restricted to investing in shari’a-compliant funds, thus giving up some diversification benefits. The possibility of international diversification among only Islamic funds may thus help Islamic investors to invest in accordance to their religious beliefs and still benefit from diversification. Design/methodology/approach – The paper assesses the benefits of diversification by analyzing the extent of co-integration among four regional Islamic funds and by estimating the short-term and long-term structural dynamics of and among these funds. The paper uses an Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to testing the long-run relationships among these funds and use variance decomposition and impulse response functions to examine the structural dynamics of the relationship between these funds. These methods can also be used for predictive purposes and represent, in authors opinion, a useful approach that complements the traditional methodology of static covariance matrix to find the efficient frontier at a given moment in time. Findings – The results indicate that international diversification can help reduce risk if Asia Pacific Islamic funds and MENA region Islamic funds are invested contemporaneously and/or Asia Pacific Islamic funds and North America Islamic funds, and/or Europe funds and MENA funds. The paper also finds that investors would benefit from investing in North American funds and MENA funds both in the long run and in the short run. Conversely, the paper finds that Europe funds and North American funds are co-integrated in the long-run precluding the opportunity for substantial diversification benefits from these particular portfolio mixes. Research limitations/implications – The long-run analysis helps passive fund managers and investors in composing their portfolio by providing evidence that some portfolio mixes of different regional Islamic funds lead to better risk return performance than one regional Islamic fund portfolios. The short-run analysis however helps the active fund managers and investors as it suggests that diversifying in the short run and reviewing their portfolio on a regular basis would be beneficial as well. Originality/value – This analysis justifies the promotion of Islamic finance as the negative correlation between several Islamic funds across the regions studied suggests better opportunities of investments via international diversification making Islamic funds more desirable.","Finance, Strategy and Management","University of Carthage, Institut des Hautes Etudes Commerciales de Carthage | American University in Dubai","Carthage | Dubai","Tunisia | United Arab Emirates"

Chinese newspapers—China Press and Sin Chew Jit Poh—provided a slightly more balanced coverage of the government and opposition coalition, Pakatan Rakyat. The bias towards political parties in the ruling coalition is attributed to the ownership of mainstreams newspapers by political interests closely aligned with the current government.

The eABC, which serves as an optimization tool for LSSVM, is enhanced by two types of mutations, namely the Levy mutation and the conventional mutation. The Levy mutation is introduced to keep the model from falling into local minimum while the conventional mutation prevents the model from over-fitting and/or under-fitting during learning. Later, the predictive analysis is followed by the LSSVM.

On the other hand, board independence and legal counsel are significantly and negatively related to Tobin's Q. Moreover, a positive but insignificant relationship is found between CEO tenure, CEO compensation, audit committee size, and the firm performance (Tobin's Q). Furthermore, board change, the role of the secretary on the board, audit committee meeting, executive committee size and executive committee meeting are revealed to have a negative but insignificant association with firm performance (Tobin's Q). Finally, this study provides recommendations for future research.","Arts and Humanities (all), Social Sciences (all), Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","Amran University | Othman Yeop Abdullah Graduate School of Business","Amran | Kuala Lumpur","Yemen | Malaysia"

In Malaysia, public-listed firms have been found to have highly concentrated ownership structure. However, whether this evidence holds for every industry has not been established. Hence, the objective of this paper is to investigate whether there are variations in ownership structure and firm's efficiency across sectors. To achieve this objective, the frequency distributions of ownership structure were calculated and firms' efficiency scores for consumer products, industrial products, construction and trading/services sectors were measured. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) under the assumptions of constant returns to scale (CRS) and variable returns to scale (VRS) was employed to estimate firms' efficiency scores. A sample of 156 firms listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) was selected using the stratified random sampling method. The findings have shown that there are variations in firm ownership structure and efficiency across sectors.","Arts and Humanities (all), Social Sciences (all), Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The outcome is translated into an instrument comprising of six social capital components based on survey items and past studies namely participation in community activities, proactivity in the social context, neighborhood connections, multi-racial tolerance, a sense of trust and protection, and life values. A pilot study involving 41 respondents was carried out in several neighboring areas in the northern part of Malaysia. The study results show that all six components have a high internal reliability value. These components of social capital are categorized into three levels namely low, moderate and high. The findings demonstrate that the majority of the four components are at the high level.

It has been argued that the anti-money laundering law makes greater inroads into the banking secrecy rule when compared to the common law or other statutes. Banks can disclose customer’s information on even grounds of suspicion of money laundering. Banking secrecy is a customer privilege, whereas combating money laundering is critical for public safety and security. Indeed, achieving a proper balance is a desirable goal. But how do we go about achieving such a balance is a question encountered by many law enforcement authorities. This paper looks into these issues. Design/methodology/approach – This paper mainly relies on statutes as its primary sources of information. As such, the relevant Malaysian laws that provide the banking secrecy rule will be identified and analyzed. It will be necessary to examine the banking secrecy rule in the Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing Act 2001 (AMLATFA) and other relevant statutes in detail, as these are the most important legislation for the purpose of this paper. Findings – On closer inspection, it is submitted that AMLATFA provides sufficient safeguards to ensure that the disclosure of customer’s information is carried out in a manner that is not prejudicial to the interest of legitimate customers. This is a positive approach that could protect the innocent customers from being mistreated by the law. Ultimately, it can be said that the growing threat of global money laundering and terrorism makes the overriding of banking secrecy justified because without a flow of information from the banks, the effective prevention of the menace is not possible. Originality/value – This paper analyzes the inroads into the banking secrecy rule under the Malaysian anti-money laundering laws. It would provide some guidelines into this particular area for academics, banks, their legal advisers, practitioners and policy makers, not only in Malaysia but also elsewhere.","Public Administration, Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all), Law","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The segmentation of lung region in chest X-ray (CXR) based on object edge detection is one of the popular method applied. Early edge detection algorithms like Sobel, Prewitt and Laplacian have been used to segment the lung however, none of them can successfully generate a truly satisfied segmentation output. The reason for this fail is because they are high pass filter that is sensitive to image noise. Hence, the requirement for better edge detection algorithm that can cope with reasonable lower and upper threshold value for image noise like canny edge should be highlighted. Moreover, combining this algorithm with morphology method (dilation and erosion) will produce better outcome. Therefore, this paper has proposed method for segmenting lung region in CXR images using canny edge filter and morphology. Although the filter can detect the lung edge, unfortunately, the final edges lines produce are still unsatisfied. To solve the problem, Euler number method is applied to extract the lung region before executing the edge detection using the filter. The implementation produced convincing result as most of the segmented image is almost similar to the ground truth image.","Artificial Intelligence, Signal Processing, Control and Systems Engineering","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This study focuses on the robustness after applied chosen attacks for the watermarked image based on the existing technique Dual Intermediate Significant Bit (DISB). This method requires embedding two bits into every pixel of the original image, while and the other six bits are changed so as to directly assimilate the original pixel. In the case, when the two hidden bits are equal or not equal to the original bits, there is a need to use mathematical equations to solve this problem. Two measurements criteria used in this study to test image robustness, the first one is Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) and Bit Error Ratio (BER).

BMTutor is a prototype for visualizing Malay sentences that is combined with sentence checker, sentence correction and word attribute components. The purpose of BMTutor is to check sentence validation, provide sentence correction for invalid sentence used and produce parse tree visualization. The research design involved can be divided into four phases; categorizing sentence and produce repository (Phase 1), developing models and algorithms (Phase 2); development of a prototype (Phase 3); and prototype testing (Phase 4). To date, this system is the only one designed with the functions and characteristics as in BMTutor. There are two BM parsers to check the validity of simple BM sentences had been developed. Both parsers performed three phases in research design, namely 1) the collection of sentence or CFG, 2) develop a prototype, and 3) conduct evaluation. The phases involved are the basic method in developing a prototype. As a result of the lack of models and algorithms have been introduced in both parsers, the model and algorithm development phase is introduced in the design of BMTutor. Output from the development process shows that the prototype is able to provide sentence correction for all 15 invalid sentences and can produce parse tree visualizations for all 20 sentences used for prototype testing.","Artificial Intelligence, Signal Processing, Control and Systems Engineering","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The aim of this article is to explore religious commitment of older people with a special reference to the rural older women in Felda Chiku, the district of Gua Musang, Kelantan, Malaysia. Using a non-probability sampling technique, a total of 70 older residents aged 50 years and above in Felda Chiku 1, Kelantan were selected as respondent. Results of the study show that almost all of older women have high level of religious commitment. Older women who have moderate and low levels of religious commitment are not significant. The implications of these findings are that religious programs should be activated so as all older persons have the awareness to comply with religion in every day life. © IDOSI Publications, 2014.","Multidisciplinary","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

As more and more tourists are becoming increasingly concerned about the environment and environmentally products, it is crucial for the hotel industry to explore this concept of green hotels in more detail. In the hotel industry, green hotels are defined as lodging establishments that have made a commitment to diverse ecologically sound practices such as saving water, energy and reducing solid waste. This study examines the influence of ecofriendly attitudes and environmentally friendly activities on tourists' intention to choose green hotels as their preferred accommodation. By using the intercept survey method, data were collected from tourists at the international airport in Malaysia. The present study confirms previous findings on the relationship between attitudes towards the environment and environment-friendly behavior, that is, tourists with high environmental attitudes are more willing to stay in a green hotel. The present study also found a positive and significant relationship of environmentally friendly activities and intention to stay at a green hotel among tourists.

Therefore, in this preliminary study, a novel framework in order to identify and classify tropical medicinal plants in Malaysia based on the extracted patterns from the leaf is presented. The extracted patterns from medicinal plant leaf are obtained based on several angle features. However, the extracted features create quite large number of attributes (features), thus degrade the performance most of the classifiers. Thus, a feature selection is applied to leaf data and to investigate whether the performance of a classifier can be improved. Wrapper based genetic algorithm (GA) feature selection is used to select the features and the ensemble classifier called Direct Ensemble Classifier for Imbalanced Multiclass Learning (DECIML) is used as a classifier. The performance of the feature selection is compared with two feature selections from Weka. In the experiment, five species of Malaysian medicinal plants are identified and classified in which will be represented by using 65 images.

This process separates an image into several areas to extract the interest object from its background. However, the segmentation task is difficult for isolating the images that captured in outdoor environment. This is due to the existence of non-uniform illumination on the object surface. Technically, different illuminations lead to different intensity on the object surface colour. This condition leads to low quality segmented images and therefore reduces the accuracy of object classification. Image segmentation can be accomplished using several methods such as Otsu, K-means and Fuzzy C-means. However, these three traditional methods have limitations in producing accurate segmented areas due to the existence of illumination on the object surface. Therefore, this paper developed a rule-based segmentation method that is able to segment natural images correctly and accurately. This method uses IF-THEN algorithm to segment the images of interest object. All four segmentation methods are implemented on fruit images and their performance are compared based on visual and quantitative evaluations. The analysis results showed that the new method is capable to produce segmented images with high accuracy rate.","Computer Science (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

However, the image processing and the process of translating an image into a statistical distribution of low-level features is not an easy task. These tasks are complicated since the acquired image data often noisy, and target objects are influenced by lighting, intensity or illumination. In the case of flower classification, image processing is a crucial step for computer-aided plant species identification. Flower image classification is based on the low-level features such as colour and texture to define and describe the image content. Colour features are extracted using normalized colour histogram and texture features are extracted using gray-level co-occurrence matrix. In this study, a dataset consists of 180 patterns with 7 attributes for each type of flower has been gathered. The finding from the study reveals that the number of images generated to represent each type of flower influences the classification accuracy. One interesting observation is that duplication of very hard to learn images assist Neural Network to improve its classification accuracy. This is also another area that could lead to better understanding towards the behaviour of images when applied to Neural Network classification.","Computer Science (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

In fact, the skill is very much needed to support a person's life economically, instead of looking for a university degree first then searching the skill or capability. This is one of the fact encountered that most of them who have a university degree but unemployed. In Indonesia, the number of scholars unemployed is getting higher statistically because most of them only rely on job vacancies, instead of becoming job creators. There is no motivation from various environments like family, friend, educational institution, etc. to build student’s mentally strong with business awareness to deal with entrepreneurial issues. Yet, when someone interested in pioneering new business, they are desperately in need of an endorsement. Entrepreneurial support usually comes from a family, partner, peers and educational institutions where they can discuss the idea of becoming an entrepreneur and entrepreneurial issues further seeking best of suggestions. A study of qualitative was conducted among Indonesian universities and their social environment that identify the factors influencing social support among business graduate students to become an entrepreneur. The study follows focused group discussion, interviews, case analysis and Delphi technique to arrive at appropriate variables on social support factors among business graduates. The study observed 2 dimensions of social support that eventually suit the attitude of business graduates to become an entrepreneur. These elements were recognized by the group of professionals from various fields. This study provides an insight into the variables of social support among business graduates to become an entrepreneur in Indonesia.

It further identifies possible ways IDE may help in order to improve visitor learning experience during their visit to historical and cultural heritage institutions. Four related institutions were selected in this study: Taman Tamadun Islam (TTI) and Architectural Museum Malaysia (AMM) which display architectural wonders of past civilizations by means of large replicas; as well as National Museum (NM) and Museum of History and Ethnography (MHE) which are dedicated to safeguarding and preserving the national heritage and history. TTI and NM have adequate general information technology infrastructure and digital exhibits are installed in their exhibition halls. AMM and MHE have less digital exhibits and most exhibits consist of a mixture of posters, artefacts, and replica. During this study, a survey was conducted by means of interview with 311 respondents who are also visitors to these four institutions. The findings of this study suggest most visitors perceived the use of IDE in general will allow easy access to information on national history and cultural heritage. They recommended IDE to be used as interpretation methods in order to make national history and cultural heritage more attractive. Interestingly, when it comes to available exhibition techniques, visitors vary their preferences on IDE over traditional means of exhibits according to the nature of these institutions. These findings reflect that museum visitors welcome the use of IDE and nevertheless appreciate the aesthetic values of real artefacts.","Computer Networks and Communications, Communication","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

However, these reports are contradictory and thus, inconclusive. Meanwhile, literature has argued extensively on the influence of cultural values on customer decision making and buying behaviour. Yet, very little is known of the interaction effect of long-term orientation on the link between trust, bonding and customer satisfaction in retail banking sector. Similarly, while several studies have documented the significant effect of customer complaints on customer loyalty, there is no noticeable research evidence on the intervening effect of service recovery on the relationship between the independent and the dependent variables.

In order to ensure that food production is guaranteed, various efforts have been taken by the government to increase the production of this commodity. Nevertheless, the impact from climate uncertainties would not merely affect the production of food but also the livelihood of paddy farmers. In an attempt to explore such impact, the Ricardian model was adopted to estimate the effect of climate change on rice production in eight granary areas in Peninsular Malaysia. In this study, a panel data from each of these areas was employed. Based on a scenario on future climate, this study expects that on average, farmers' income would decline by 67% in 2020 to 2029, 88% in 2050 to 2059 and 127% in 2090 to 2099. The loss of paddy income would certainly affect the livelihood of farmers. Hence, the Paddy Price Subsidy Scheme (Skim Subsidi Harga Padi [SSHP]) is envisaged as one of the government's interventions that is required to be maintained to reduce the effect. This is supported by a case study conducted in MADA that found that the number of extreme poverty farmers in the Muda irrigation area will increase by 2.2%; poor, 9.3%; and vulnerable, 61.3% if the government decides to withdraw the paddy price subsidy scheme. Therefore, to ensure the survival of paddy farmers in encountering this unavoidable natural phenomenon, an appropriate strategy through government intervention needs to be comprehensively developed.","Cultural Studies, History, Sociology and Political Science","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia","Bangi","Malaysia"

Findings from this study suggested that changes in eating behavior should not emphasize only on limiting the food portion size consumption. The efforts should also consider other eating events such as controlling the meal frequency and limiting intake of high-calorie food in developing guidelines to prevent obesity.","Physics and Astronomy (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

There was a huge swing from the urban and suburban constituencies toward supporting the PR. One of the major contributors to the result was the social media which was once again dominated by the PR, similar to what happened in 2008. Social media is trendy, cheap and easy to access especially for youths who made up half of the voters totalling 13.3 million. Online channels such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, news portals and blogs are popular and became the avenues for political parties from both BN and PR alike for campaigning and tools for the leaders and candidates to meet the electorates in respective constituencies. The impact was enormous for PR parties which were able to utilise it to their advantages, letting the 2013 general election become competitive and strengthening the democratic process in Malaysia. Thus, this article studies the correlation between the phenomena of social media and democracy. It then explores the conditions and effects of social media in Malaysia. Finally, this article analyses thoroughly the impact of social media in the GE13. Based on overall observation, the social media is still dominated by the PR. The election results reflect the influence of social media in Malaysian politics.","Cultural Studies, History, Sociology and Political Science","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

While past research studied the effect of web design toward users' motivation; not many are looking into the persuasive value of the design. It is foreseen that the power of visual persuasion would produce a more persuasive website and consequently give impact on the users' first impression, and thus motivate them to stay at a site long enough to influence specific behavioural intentions. The proposed model aims to discover the potential of visual persuasion in influencing web users' motivation.

A new DEA model for handling crisp data using fuzzy concept is proposed. In addition, the relationship between possibility sets and the efficiency score in the traditional crisp CCR model is presented. The relationship provides an alternative perspective of viewing efficiency. With the usage of the appropriate fuzzy and possibility sets to represent certain characteristics of the input data, many DEA models involving input data with various characteristics could be studied. Furthermore, based upon the proposed models, two nondiscretionary models are introduced in which some inputs or outputs, in a fuzzy sense, are inexact discretionary variables. For this purpose, a two-stage algorithm will be presented to treat the DEA model in the presence of an inexact discretionary variable.

FA is a nature-inspired algorithm that is used in many optimization problems. The FA is realized in document clustering by executing it on Reuters-21578 database. The algorithm identifies documents that has the highest light intensity in a search space and represents it as a centroid. This is followed by recognizing similar documents using the cosine similarity function. Documents that are similar to the centroid are located into one cluster and dissimilar in the other. Experiments performed on the chosen dataset produce high values of Purity and F-measure.

These features provide fine queries to locate object location as well as its relation with others within an image. In fact, spatial features which is portrayed by spatial features terms (SFT) such as left, right, on and in, have been applied in many research domains to denote image attributes. Although the features play an important role in representing image, yet, many researches still rely on visual features for that matter. This condition is also applied in medical image such as Chest X-ray (CXR) image. There is less effort done to identify the actual SFT that should be used to describe the anomalies like lung nodule in CXR image. To overcome this problem, collection of SFTs for describing CXR image must be identified. Hence, this paper presents the effort in identifying the type of SFT that should be used to describe lung nodule in CXR. In order to identify the term, ten radiologists were asked to describe lung nodules in ten CXR images. As a result, five SFTs that are frequently use to describe the image, i.e. left, right, upper, middle and lower were derived from the descriptions. These SFTs are able to visualize the lung region divisions vertically and horizontally within CXR image.","Artificial Intelligence","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Specifically, this study explores the concept of ethical leadership in relation to corporate governance. It introduces morality as a core element in creating good governance practices, starting from the premise that corporate governance is subjective. We must therefore consider the social reality in which corporate governance is based. As such, inquiry about the social reality is required. Based on that premise, qualitative methodology is employed to gather views about the concept of ethical leadership in the context of corporate governance. The socially constructed reality of this study is represented by individuals who were categorised as experts and corporations known to have a high standard of corporate governance. Views from the subjects about ethics in the perspective of corporate governance were gathered. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. Triangulation techniques of data collection were adopted to provide richness and thickness to the data. Interviews, document analysis and observations were used to understand the reality of the research issue. Triangulation techniques support the validation and reliability of data. The research found several ethical leadership attributes that are essential to guide corporate governance practices. They are fundamental elements that have emerged from the data.

It is critical that business owners correctly determine whether the individuals providing services are employees or independent contractors. Employers or 'masters' will only be liable for the torts of their employees or 'servants' as they are called in law. They will not usually be liable for the torts of their independent contractors (subject to some exceptions). It is, therefore, necessary to establish the status of the person who committed the wrongful act. The task of the court is to interpret the contract of employment. In order to make such a distinction, the courts have adopted certain tests. However, the courts have been unable to formulate a concise definition of the terms 'employee' and 'independent contractor' that will furnish an accurate test to be applied in determining whether one is acting for another as servant or as an independent contractor. In Malaysia, the courts generally favour the control test. While the control test may have been persuasive in the past, in modern industrial society, with its increasingly sophisticated division of labour, the test is not always effective. In many cases employees may have technical skills and knowledge not shared by their employers. The purpose of this article is to examine these tests and the problems posed by the tests used by the Malaysian courts in an attempt to draw a distinction between an employee and an independent contractor in the context of vicarious liability.","Business, Management and Accounting (all), Arts and Humanities (all), Social Sciences (all), Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Design/methodology/approach - A definition of survival time that considers the date when the new Egyptian listing rules were enforced to track delisting status for each IPO firm for five survival years is relied on. Binary logit regression analysis is used to identify these determinants. Total sample is divided into two subsamples: the first subsample covers the period from 1992 to 2004. It is used to estimate the logit equations and to predict delisting status of firms included in the second subsample, which covers the period from 2005 to 2009. Findings - The probability of involuntary delisting decreases significantly with the increase in firm size, institutional ownership, assets growth rate, operating efficiency, offering size, initial returns and insider ownership. However, it increases significantly in IPO firms with high financial leverage. Based on the estimated logit regression equations, the status of the six firms included in the second subsample are correctly predicted. Practical implications - The results provide several implications for investors, issuing firms and setters of listing rules. Originality/value - This study uses new variables, such as firm type, institutional ownership and listing variables.

However, large number of features extraction will increase the complexity of the diagnosis system. Therefore, in this paper, we presented a diagnosis method which is hybridization of adaptive genetic algorithms (AGAs), back propagation neural networks (BPNNs), and grey relational analysis (GRA) to diagnose the condition of multiple bearings system. AGAs are used in the diagnosis algorithm to determine the best initial weights of BPNNs in order to improve the diagnosis accuracy. In addition, GRA is applied to determine and select the dominant features from the vibration signal data which will provide good diagnosis of multiple bearings system in less features extraction.

In this paper, a new recursive strategy is proposed to generate starter sets that will not incur equivalence by circular operation.

The results of the growth model indicate that FDI, human capital and workers' remittances have positive and statistically significant impacts on economic growth. Moreover, the research outcomes show that corruption discourage economic growth directly in Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam and also indirectly, through FDI inflows – in Thailand. The findings of this study suggest that proper attention needs to be given to such problems as insufficient infrastructure, economic and political stability in order to invite more FDI.

The results indicate that there is a longrun relationship between the variables. The Toda-Yamamoto causality test is employed to investigate the direction of causality between the variables. The results show a two-ways causality that runs from economic growth to education and from education to economic growth for the sample period. In other words, economic growth has an unswerving and significant bump on education and vice versa in case of Malaysia. The findings suggest that Malaysian's government needs to increase public expenditure on divergent components of education to boost further economic growth.

Besides that, serious game also gains its own popularity among children and adolescence. Given the wide popularity of serious game, therapists realize the advantages of using games as the assistive tool in psychotherapy so called therapeutic game. However, the lack of available comprehensive guideline for design and development of therapeutic game is still a barrier to the game developers to produce a high quality therapeutic game. Henceforward, this research aims to propose a design model by integrating core elements of selected therapeutic approach that is cognitive behavior therapy. The main issue in psychotherapy is engagement of adolescents into psychotherapy. To address this problem, the proposed model also integrates player experience as the essential element, which is highly related with engagement.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are one of the most popular methods for classification in condition diagnosis of bearing systems. Regarding to ANNs performance, ANNs parameters have important role especially connectivity weights. In several running of learning processes with the same structure of ANNs, we can obtain different accuracy significantly since initial weights are selected randomly. Therefore, finding the best weights in learning process is an important task for obtaining good performance of ANNs. Previous researchers have proposed some methods to get the best weights such as simple average and majority voting. However, these methods have some limitations in providing the best weights especially in condition diagnosis of bearing systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid technique of multiple classifier-ANNs (mANNs) and adaptive probabilities in genetic algorithms (APGAs) to obtain the best weights of ANNs in order to increase the classification performance of ANNs in condition diagnosis of bearing systems. The mANNs are used to provide several best initial weights which are optimized by APGAs. The set optimized weights from APGAs, afterward, are used as the best weights for condition diagnosis. Our experiment shows mANNs-APGAs give better results than of the simple average and majority voting in condition diagnosis of bearing systems. This experiment also shows the distinction of maximum and minimum accuracy in mANNs-APGAs is lower than the two existing methods.","Control and Systems Engineering, Control and Optimization","Bina Nusantara University","Jakarta","Indonesia"

Therefore, this conceptual paper provides an insight on the definition and implementation of GSCM as well as to illustrate the current state of GSCM adoption in Malaysia. This paper is expected to present a thorough review on the three main practices of GSCM namely eco-design, green purchasing and reverse logistics. Ecodesign mainly aims to decrease the product’s environmental effect; while green purchasing is inevitably important to minimize the environmental effect of purchased materials; and reverse logistic concentrates on the logistic and inventory activities.

Result of the study shows that in the short run, there is a unidirectional causality running from real money supply to inflation, government deficit to price level, real output to inflation, and interest rate to inflation. The long run results indicate that bidirectional causality runs between the real money supply and price level, and also between price level and interest rate. The results suggest that pro-cyclical has been the practice in Nigerian fiscal policy which has accounted for the country’s public deficit. Therefore, there is a need for fiscal policy rule that will guide all the tiers of government to a particular level of fiscal conduct and budgetary management to the extent of making it credible over time. This result is important in that it provides the likely implications of fiscal deficits on some macroeconomic variables such as output, price level, money supply and balance of payment. Knowing these implications is likely to provide an insight into the formulation and design of appropriate fiscal policy by the Nigerian policy makers because far from the efficient provision of public goods, fiscal policy performs stabilizing role.","Business and International Management, Economics and Econometrics, Political Science and International Relations","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Rationally, these insiders will not adhere to the lock-up agreement unless the benefits of doing so can more than offset the costs. Therefore, in an environment characterized by high information asymmetry, a lock-up agreement can serve as an effective mechanism to signal the risk or quality of firms. This article examines whether the lock-up ratio and lock-up period affect the initial returns, using a sample of 384 IPOs listed on Bursa Malaysia between 2000 and 2012. The results of the cross-sectional multiple regression show that the lock-up period is significantly positive in explaining IPO initial returns, but the lock-up ratio is not. The findings provide new insights for testing the signaling content of lock-up provisions, particularly in a setting characterized by high information asymmetry.","Economics and Econometrics","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The customers' perception of the bank had deteriorated and in the External Customer Engagement Survey conducted among its customers in 2008, the bank was rated the 17th out of 18 banks in terms of customer service. In 2008, the bank's CEO was replaced by a new leader. This new leader brought a different kind of leadership style into the bank. Moreover, at the time of the new CEO steering the helm of leadership in Industrial Bank, the market was going through merger and acquisition exercise and was in the midst of acquiring stakes at three countries namely Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam. Bank Negara has also relaxed the rules for Foreign financial service provider especially Islamic banks to open more branches in Malaysia. The slow economic pace also had an effect on the bank.

Logistic regression techniques are employed in analyzing data. The results of Model 1 indicate that education, other assets and spousal dislike to female head of households are observed as the significant barriers of participation. The outcome of the Model 2 suggests that there have been six factors that inhibit the rural poor participation in MFIs which are gender, age, yearly income, land, religion and lack of knowledge.

Besides, the middle-class is also reported to face ""the middle-class trap"", where on the one hand, they are regarded as ""too rich "" to qualify for any government support, but on the other hand, they found themselves in reality ""not too rich "" to sustain their lives without facing hardships. These observations unfortunately seem to be equally true in Malaysia, which raises the need to scrutinise the likely impact of government policy on the middle-class. With the recent fuel subsidy rationalisation in Malaysia, this paper attempts to analyse the likely welfare impact of this policy towards the middle-class in the Malaysian society. Examining this issue is crucial and desirable since the problems faced by the middle-class tend to be overlooked by the policy makers. In our analysis, we use various definitions of ""middle-class "" as suggested in the literature, and examine the direct, indirect and the total welfare effects of fuel subsidy removal on them using data from the Household Expenditure Survey (HES) 2004/2005 as well as the Input-Output Table for 2004/2005. Our findings reveal that, in line with the common perception, the benefits of fuel subsidy accrued mostly to the rich. Ironically, the costs of subsidy removal are borne mostly by the middle-class in terms of the direct effect. Yet in terms of the indirect welfare effect, the costs of subsidy removal are borne equally by the middle-class as well as the lower and the upper class. Since the indirect welfare effect outweighs the direct welfare effect, we conclude that while the rich get most of the benefits from fuel subsidy, its removal hurts the middle-class the most. Our finding implies that fuel subsidy rationalisation must be followed by a practical strategy and program to lessen the negative impact of fuel subsidy removal not only for the poor, but also for the middle-class as well.","Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Since the series are integrated of order 1 and appear to be cointegrated, we utilize the Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS) to estimate the determinants of trade between Malaysia and OIC countries. The FMOLS estimation reported that per capita GDP, Foreign Direct Investement (FDI) differential and real exchange rate of OIC member countries are supporting the expansion of the exports whereas any increase in trade per GDP ratio, corruption and real exchange rate of Malaysia creates additional impediments to the trade relation. The findings suggest that economic strengthening as the basis for increase in trade between Malaysia and OIC members.

One of the main factors is the rise in world oil prices, coupled with heightened interest in the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions and concerns about energy security. The increment in production has been driven by governmental interventions. In the US, the world's largest fuel ethanol producer, strong financial incentives are guaranteed for biofuel manufacturers. While, in the European Union, the worlds largest biodiesel producer, biofuel consumption is mostly driven by blending mandates in both France and Germany. In the case of Malaysia, biodiesel started to be exported since 2006. The policy mandate of B5 blend of palm oil based biodiesel into diesel in all government vehicles was implemented in Februarv 2009. It is expected that the blend of B5 will be increased to B10 in future. This paper seeks to examine the impact of BIO on the Malaysian palm oil market. A structural econometric model consisting of eight structural equations and four identities was proposed in this study. The model has been estimated by two stage least squares method using annual data for the period 1976-2011. The specification of the structural model is based on a series of assumptions about general economic conditions, agricultural policies and technological change. The study indicates that counterfactual simulation of an increase from B5 to B10 predicts a positive increase (23.31 per cent) in palm oil domestic consumption. 109.3 per cent decrease in stock. 0.07 per cent increase in domestic price of palm oil and a marginal (0.05 percent) Increase in production. An increase in domestic demand would make Malaysia more competitive regionally and globally with benefits accruing to all Malaysians.","Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

It aimed to identify the level of TQM practices and school climate in three different categories of schools, namely high, average and low performance schools. The study also sought to examine which dimensions of TQM practices contributed the most to school climate. Methodology - A survey was administered to 691 teachers from 24 secondary schools to obtain information on TQM practices and school climate. Descriptive statistics was used to examine the level of TQM and school climate and inferential statistics (correlation coefficient and multiple regression) was used to examine relationships between the variables. Findings - There were significant differences between the levels of TQM practices in the three different categories of schools. High performance schools showed a higher level of TQM practice and school climate, followed by average performance schools and low performance schools. There was a significant positive relationship between the variables on the level of TQM practices and school climate. TQM was a predictor of school climate contributing to 40 percent of the variance towards school climate. For the dimension of TQM practices, staff involvement, commitment of the top management and continuous improvement were the main predictors of school climate.

It is based on a study conducted to compare the effects of TAS on motivation among Thai students. The issue of motivation among Asian students has invited controversy as few cross-cultural relativists have claimed that Asian students get motivated when teachers use controlling strategies. Methodology - The study collected data through a quasiexperimental study with an appended ABA withdrawal design. The subjects were 105 Thai students who completed self-reported questionnaires that assessed perceived autonomy support, intrinsic motivation and self-regulation, before, after and on withdrawal of experiment intervention. Findings - MANOVA results revealed that students in the experimental group who were in the autonomy supportive teachinglearning environment reported greater interest, effort, relatedness and integrated regulation compared to the control group taught using a traditional approach. Furthermore, students in the experimental group experienced less pressure and reported less external regulation compared to the control group. Significance - The findings support the claim in Self-determination theory (SDT) that autonomy is not a culturally bound value, and is a pedagogical concept equally relevant to Thai students as it facilitates motivation. The findings will encourage Thai educators to adopt autonomy as a pedagogical concept that will help facilitate motivation among their students.","Cultural Studies, Education, Psychology (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The perceptions of the graduates and employers towards the effectiveness of the programmes were analyzed. The effectiveness of Finishing School programmes evaluated through a graduate marketability outcome study and the expectations of employers with regard to the type of soft skills of graduates most needed by industries were also examined. Methodology - Data for this study were obtained through a survey questionnaire administered to graduates and focus group interviews with selected employers. The primary data involved a large sample (n = 1092) of graduates from public universities and also 31 selected employers from various industries. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests, and a multinomial logit model. Due to the unavailability of a population frame, the data were collected using a convenient sampling design. Findings - Graduates had a positive perception of the effectiveness of Finishing School programmes. However, in terms of the marketability outcome, Finishing school programmes currently being offered were seen as ineffective. Interviews with officers at the management level from various companies showed that the local graduates were lacking in certain types of soft skills, particularly in English communication skills, compared with their counterparts who graduated from higher education institutions overseas. Employerslisted three skills as critical for graduates to have, namely, problem solving skills, information management (exposure to general knowledge, current issues and ICT) and English communication. Significance - Most of the soft skills which employers have identified as important in enhancing graduates' employability have long been emphasized by the local higher learning institutions through their Finishing School programmes. Hence, it was concluded that the existing Finishing School programmes are indeed moving in the right direction in achieving its desired objectives. However, there is still room for improvement. This is especially so in relation toits implementation as the empirical evidence seems to suggest that current Finishing School programmes are not effective in terms of graduate marketability outcome.","Education","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

A clear feature of this count variable is excess zeros, and it is essential to incorporate this feature in the modelling strategy. Accordingly, in addition to standard Poisson and negative binomial models, zero-inflated, two-part, and latent class models were estimated. The zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB) proved, on the basis of several selection criteria, to be superior to other models for this dataset. As anticipated, health related variables had significant effects in determining health care utilisation while socioeconomic variables appeared to be less important, according to the results from the preferred model.

Therefore, partial transmit sequence (PTS), a promising scheme that can provide good PAPR reduction performance, has been proposed for OFDM transmission to eliminate distortion. The PTS method divides the input data block into disjoint sub-blocks, computes Inverse Fourier Transform of the subblocks, rotates the sub-blocks with appropriate phase factors and combines them to form the transmitted signal. This paper presents an enhanced PTS approach that combines two PTS partitioning schemes (adjacent and interleaved) to effectively reduce the PAPR of the OFDM systems. The influence of the proposed approach on performance is investigated by varying the size of the disjoint sub-blocks. The PAPR reduction performance of the proposed PTS method is compared with two well known sub-blocks partitioning schemes, namely, Adjacent Partitioning (AP), Interleaved Partitioning (IP). The various computer simulation results for the various sub-blocks confirmed that the proposed method provides better PAPR reduction performance compared with AP and IP partitioning based PTS scheme. In addition, these PTS schemes largely depend on the chosen size of the partitions.","Engineering (all)","Universiti Malaysia Perlis","Arau","Malaysia"

To this end, an energy audit can be conducted to assess the energy efficiency. This study aims to analyze the energy usage of a primary school and identify the potential energy reductions and cost savings. A preliminary audit was conducted, and several energy conservation measures were proposed. The energy conservation measures, with reference to the MS1525:2007 standard, were modelled to identify the potential energy reduction and cost savings. It was found that the school's usage of electricity exceeded its need, incurring an excess expenditure of RM 2947.42. From the lighting system alone, it was found that there is a potential energy reduction of 5489.06 kWh, which gives a cost saving of RM 2282.52 via the improvement of lighting system design and its operating hours. Overall, it was found that there is a potential energy reduction and cost saving of 20.7% when the energy conservation measures are earnestly implemented.

In this type of networks, the nodes work of forwarding packets together. Routing protocols are worked based on multihop to discover a path from source to destination node when the direct path between them does not exist. One of the standard MANET protocols is Ad hoc on-demand distance vector protocol (AODV). AODV is attacked by many types of attacks such as black hole attack due its routing mechanism. Black hole provides highest destination sequence number and lowest hop count number to attract sourcenode and drop the packets. Most previous works were used trusted neighbor nodes for preventing black hole attack and making AODV more secure. However, these solutions suffer from high routing overhead and missing specific mechanism for providing a shortest secure path. In this paper, we propose an intelligent preventing technique for AODV to prevent black hole attacks, which is called Shortest Secure Path for AODV (SSP-AODV). This intelligent technique is integrated A* and Floyd-Warshall’s algorithms. The simulation is conducted in Network Simulator 2. The results indicate that the proposed intelligent technique outperform standard AODV in two terms; packet loss delivery and average End-to-End delay.

Results of Panel ECM show that out of all variables GDP and TRGDP are positively effect on exports. Finally, results of Granger Causality show that only CPI, GDP and TRGDP are cause exports in Malaysia. The government of Malaysia through understood the importance of exports with TPP member countries to boost economic growth. The latter not only contributes to economic growth through capital formation but also promotes trade activity by making financial resources available at lower cost; attracting foreign direct investment as well as facilitating development of advanced technology. Moreover, this study not only contribute to the exports and economic growth literature but also will guide the policy maker to chalk out right, effective and appropriate policy in order to improve exports between Malaysia and TPP countries.","Multidisciplinary","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Solving a MC problem is basically the process of finding the overall performance or overall quality of the units of analysis by using certain aggregation method. Based on these overall measures of each unit, a decision can be made whether to sort them, to select the best or to group them according to certain ranges. Prior to solving the MC problems, the weights of the related criteria have to be determined with the assumption that the weights represent the degree of importance or the degree of contribution towards the overall performance of the units. This paper presents two main approaches which are called as subjective and objective approaches, where the first one involves evaluator(s) while the latter approach depends on the intrinsic information contained in each criterion. The subjective and objective weights are defined if the criteria are assumed to be independent with each other, but if they are dependent, there is another type of weight, which is called as monotone measure weight or compound weights which represent degree of interaction among the criteria. The measure of individual weights or compound weights must be addressed in solving multi-criteria problems so that the solutions are more reliable since in the real world, evaluation criteria always come with different degree of importance or are dependent with each other. As the real MC problems have their own uniqueness, it is up to the decision maker(s) to decide which type of weights and which method are the most applicable ones for the problem under study.","Physics and Astronomy (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

We describe a strategy in order to identify and to handle the outliers in the process of constructing a classification tree. A Winsorised approach is suggested in estimating the impurity of the data prior to the splitting of each node of a tree. The proposed estimator provides a splitting value that resistant towards outliers in the data hence influences the performance based on plug in error rate of the tree.

In this paper, we explore four ways to rate competitors; least squares rating, maximum likelihood strength ratio, standing points in large round robin simulation and previous league rank position. The tournament metric we used to evaluate different types of rating approach is tournament outcome characteristics measure. The tournament outcome characteristics measure is defined by the probability that a particular team in the top 100q pre-tournament rank percentile progress beyond round R, for all q and R. Based on simulation result, we found that different rating approach produces different effect to the team. Our simulation result shows that from eight teams participate in knockout standard seeding, Perak has highest probability to win for tournament that use the least squares rating approach, PKNS has highest probability to win using the maximum likelihood strength ratio and the large round robin simulation approach, while Perak has the highest probability to win a tournament using previous league season approach.","Physics and Astronomy (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

In the European Union, biofuel consumption is mostly driven by blending mandates in both France and Germany. In the case of Malaysia, biodiesel has started to be exported since 2006. The B5 of 5% blend of palm oil based biodiesel into diesel in all government vehicles was implemented in February 2009 and it is expected to be implemented nationwide in the nearest time. How will the blend mandate will project growth in the domestic demand of palm oil in Malaysia? To analyze this issue, a system dynamics model was constructed to evaluate the impact of blend mandate implementation on the palm oil domestic demand influence. The base run of simulation analysis indicates that the trend of domestic demand will increase until 2030 in parallel with the implementation of 5 percent of biodiesel mandate.

Despite the high penetration of smartphone, previous studies have exhibited inconsistent findings towards understanding the behavioural intention to use smartphone especially among university students. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine purchasing behaviour of Smartphone among students. From the literature, five antecedents of purchasing behaviour were identified. Each variable is measured using 7-point Likert scale: convenience (10 items), social influence (6 items), self-efficacy (10 items), facilitating condition (11 items), dependency (14 items) and purchasing behaviour (4 items). Using the primary data collection method, 400 questionnaires were distributed to the target respondents of one of the public higher education in the northern region. The responses collected were 350 completed questionnaires representing 87.5 percent response rate. The data were analysed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using AMOS. Confirmatory factor analysis of measurement models indicates adequate goodness or fit after few items were eliminated through modification indices verifications. Therefore, goodness of fit for the generated structural model shows the adequate fit. This study has established four direct significant causal effects and two significant mediating effects: (1) convenience and dependency, (2) social influence and dependency, (3) facilitating condition and purchase behaviour, (4), dependency and purchase behaviour. The significant mediating results are: (1). Dependency mediates the relationship between convenience and purchase behaviour; (2) dependency mediates social influence and purchase behaviour. Thus, findings suggested that convenience, social influence and dependency play a role in determining students purchase behaviour of smartphone. The researchers hope the findings of this study will contribute theoretically and practically to scholars, marketers and smartphone manufacturers.","Physics and Astronomy (all)","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The test is based on the Wilcoxon signed rank statistic W, which is the smaller of the two ranks sums. The steps to compute W consider the positive and negative differences and omit all the zero differences. In this study, we modify the Wilcoxon signed rank test using the indicator function of positive, zero and negative differences to compute the Wilcoxon statistic, W. The empirical Type I error rates of the modified statistical test was measured via Monte Carlo simulation. These rates were obtained under different distributional shapes, sample sizes, and number of replications.

One aspect of this concern has been the idea that overcrowding can enhance the occurrence of serious incidents during events. As one of the largest Muslim religious gathering attended by pilgrims from all over the world, Hajj has become extremely overcrowded with many incidents being reported. The purpose of this study is to analyze the nature of human emotion and negative behavior resulting from overcrowding during Hajj events from data gathered in Malaysian Hajj Experience Survey in 2013. The sample comprised of 147 Malaysian pilgrims (70 males and 77 females). Utilizing a probabilistic model called Bayesian network, this paper models the dependence structure between different emotions and negative behaviors of pilgrims in the crowd. The model included the following variables of emotion: negative, negative comfortable, positive, positive comfortable and positive spiritual and variables of negative behaviors; aggressive and hazardous acts. The study demonstrated that emotions of negative, negative comfortable, positive spiritual and positive emotion have a direct influence on aggressive behavior whereas emotion of negative comfortable, positive spiritual and positive have a direct influence on hazardous acts behavior. The sensitivity analysis showed that a low level of negative and negative comfortable emotions leads to a lower level of aggressive and hazardous behavior. Findings of the study can be further improved to identify the exact cause and risk factors of crowd-related incidents in preventing crowd disasters during the mass gathering events.","Physics and Astronomy (all)","Universiti Sains Malaysia","Minden","Malaysia"

The more nurses are unsatisfied with their working environment the more severe the condition or implication they tend to leave. Therefore, the current undesirable work schedule is partly due to that working condition. Basically, there is a lack of complimentary requirement between the head nurse's liability and the nurses' need. In particular, subject to highly nurse preferences issue, the sophisticated challenge of doing nurse scheduling is failure to stimulate tolerance behavior between both parties during shifts assignment in real working scenarios. Inevitably, the flexibility in shifts assignment is hard to achieve for the sake of satisfying nurse diverse requests with upholding imperative nurse ward coverage. Hence, Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is proposed to cater for this complexity in a nurse scheduling problem (NSP). The restriction of EA is discussed and thus, enhancement on the EA operators is suggested so that the EA would have the characteristic of a flexible search. This paper consists of three types of constraints which are the hard, semi-hard and soft constraints that can be handled by the EA with enhanced parent selection and specialized mutation operators. These operators and EA as a whole contribute to the efficiency of constraint handling, fitness computation as well as flexibility in the search, which correspond to the employment of exploration and exploitation principles.","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Ecology, Plant Science, Physics and Astronomy (all), Nature and Landscape Conservation","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

These important resources are identified as water, fertilizer, natural fertilizer, pesticides and labour. The current agricultural patterns in Iraq affect the strategic crops cultivation in the country and lessen agricultural production to some life-threatening limits. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is a non-parametric tool, is proposed to identify solutions that can maximize farmers' net benefit making an optimal use of the five resources. This model also improves optimal mix of the resources. In reference to the production of each one of the three strategic crops in Iraq, the DEA model is used to find the efficiency of one region among four others in its agriculture sector, with the main problem being the constraint in the number of lands available in the situation. Hence, the simulation technique is used to generate additional regions to the four main regions adopted. This is to resolve the constriction of DEA when the decision making unit is less than the number of variables (outputs and inputs).

This paper presents a real-world, capacitated examination timetabling problem from Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM), Malaysia. This dataset differs from the others reported in the literature with respect to its size, complexity and constraints. Until recently, examination timetabling in UUM is done manually with a little guidance from spreadsheet computer software for checking clashes. The propriety system is unable to do the examination timetabling automatically. Besides, the introduced datasets also consider a new constraint that has never been modeled before in timetabling literature, which is lecturer's preference. Moreover, splitting examination across several rooms and a number of hard constraints such as no mixed duration of examination within individual periods, clashes free schedule and room capacity requirement are also need to be adhered. These constraints provide an additional challenge in solving the examination timetabling problem, mainly at UUM. In this paper, graph coloring heuristics are employed to schedule examinations at each step during timetable construction. We used the concept of bin packing heuristics to assign examination to room with respect to the capacity. Since this is a new dataset and no solutions have been published in the literature yet, we only compare the results with an existing manual solution.

However, not all data encompassed with these assumptions. Consequently, the result produced by independent sample t-test becomes invalid. Therefore, the alternative is to use robust statistical procedure in handling the problems of nonnormality and variances heterogeneity. This study proposed to use Parametric Bootstrap test with popular robust estimators, MADn and Tn which empirically determines the amount of trimming. The Type I error rates produced by each procedure were examined and compared with classical parametric test and nonparametric test namely independent sample t-test and Mann Whitney test, respectively. 5000 simulated data sets are used in this study in order to generate the Type I error for each procedure. The findings of this study indicate that the Parametric Bootstrap test with MADn and Tn produces the best Type I error control compared to the independent sample t-test and the Mann Whitney test under nonnormal distribution, heterogeneous variances and unbalanced design. Then, the performance of each procedure was demonstrated using real data.","Physics and Astronomy (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

However, survivability is the main issue among DPOW. Frequent communication with influential webloggers is one of the way to keep survive as DPOW. This paper aims to understand the network structure and identify influential webloggers within the network. Proper understanding of the network structure can assist us in knowing how the information is exchanged among members and enhance survivability among DPOW. 30 DPOW were involved in this study.

However one of the assumptions in MANOVA requires the data to be normally distributed. This study concerned with the violation of this assumption, particularly when the data are either moderately non-normal or extremely non-normal. Possible alternative methods of handling such data are (i) permutational MANOVA (PMANOVA) or (ii) analysis of distance (AoD). Both of these alternative methods were compared with MANOVA via Monte Carlo experiments using the power of tests. The experiments focussed on testing interaction effects by incorporating different data types (i.e. having multivariate normal distribution, moderately non-normal and extremely non-normal), three level of inter-variable correlations (low: 0.25, medium: 0.5 and high: 0.75), two designs (small: 3×3 and large: 7×7) and two sample sizes (2 and 5 replicates). Overall, the results revealed that irrespective of the data types and the level of inter-variable correlations MANOVA performed satisfactorily in situations having larger sample size (5 replicates). In these situations, no alternative method is necessary. However, in small design with high inter-variable correlations PMANOVA performed slightly better. In small samples (2 replicates), AoD outperformed both MANOVA and PMANOVA. This is especially true in situation having small sample (2 replicates), large design and highly correlated inter-variables.","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Ecology, Plant Science, Physics and Astronomy (all), Nature and Landscape Conservation","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

In this study, integer programming technique is used to develop an appropriate product-mix planning to obtain the optimal number of audio speaker products that should be produced in order to maximize profit. Branch-and-bound method is applied to obtain exact integer solutions when non-integer solutions occurred. Three major resource constraints are considered in this problem: raw materials constraint, demand constraint and standard production time constraint. It is found that, the developed integer programming model gives significant increase in profit compared to the existing method used by the company. At the end of the study, sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of changes in objective function coefficient and available resources on the developed model.

This is caused by lack of employment, capital to establish businesses to earn income, cultural factor, tradition and religion. Women are supposed to be players in assisting their households and in economic growth and development of any nation. Unfortunately, they are prevented as a result of poverty. Microfinance institutions were established for the past decades to help women in fulfilling their dreams of getting out of poverty. These programs of microfinance institutions have expanded across the globe, to provide the financial needs of poor women who do not have the capacity to access funds from traditional banks. This has been possible due to the intervention of nongovernmental organization and support of governments. This support contributes to economic growth and development of their households, communities and the country at large. The main aim of this study is to examine poverty alleviation in Northeast Nigeria, mediation of performance and the moderating effect of microfinance training. Based on the findings of the literature review and the need for more studies, a conceptual framework was developed to test this relationship.

Meticulously, the Quran contains much important information related to female. However, this information are scattered and complexly linked. Technically, to extract and present the encapsulated knowledge on female matters in the Quran is a challenging task. Thus, this paper discusses on how to understand and represent the knowledge in an easy way. A total of 18 female terms are identified. Through the terms, the name of surah, verses number and text from the verses are gathered. The texts are then analyzed and clustered into specific issues.

Users prefer service providers who meet the commitments specified in the Service Level Agreements to these who violate them. Cloud computing has been the recent entrant to the distributed system market and has revolutionized it by transforming the way the resources are accessed and paid for. Users can access cloud services including hardware, development platform and applications and pay only for the usage similar to the other utilities. Trust computing mechanisms can play an important role in identifying the right service providers who would meet the commitments specified in the Service Level Agreements. Literature has reported several trust computing mechanisms for different distributed systems based on various algorithms and functions. Almost all of them modify the trust scores monotonously even for momentary performance deviations that are reported. This paper proposes a trust computing mechanism that statistically validates the attribute monitored before modifying the trust scores using a hysteresisbased algorithm. Hence the proposed mechanism can protect the trust scores from changes due to momentary fluctuations in system performances. The experiments conducted show that the trust scores computed using the proposed mechanism are more representative of the long-term system performance than the ones that were computed without the validation of the inputs.","Computer Science (all), Mathematics (all)","University of Moratuwa","Moratuwa","Sri Lanka"

However, to date there is no general consensus on the effective personality types and diversity based on software team roles. Thus, this paper aims to discover the effective personality types and diversity based on two software team roles - team leader and programmer by using a rule-based approach. The rule-based approach by employing the rough set technique was used to discover patterns of the data selected. In this study, four main steps were involved to discover the patterns - reduct generation rules, rules generation, rules filtering, and rules evaluation. The results show that the rules generated achieved acceptable prediction accuracy with more than 70 per cent accuracy. In addition, the ROC value achieved 0.65, which indicates the rule-based model is valid and useful. The results reveal that the extrovert personality type is dominant for both software team roles and a homogeneous or heterogeneous team plays an equal role to determine an effective team. This study provides useful rules for decision makers to understand and get insight into selecting effective team members that lead to producing high quality software.","Computer Science (all), Mathematics (all)","Sukkur IBA University","Sukkur","Pakistan"

We extend the work on Gravitation Firefly Algorithm (GFA) by introducing a relocate mechanism that relocates assigned documents, if necessary. The newly proposed clustering algorithm, known as GFA_R, is then tested on a benchmark dataset obtained from the 20Newsgroups. Experimental results on external and relative quality metrics for the GFA_R is compared against the one obtained using the standard GFA and Bisect K-means.

According to Malaysian Education Blueprint (2012) pre-service service teachers of Universiti Utara Malaysia are expected to master Information and Communication Technology (ICT) integration in the teaching and learning process (MOE, 2013). This study measures the level of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) outlined by Mishra and Koehler (2006). It includes seven knowledge dimensions, namely Content Knowledge (CK), Pedagogical Knowledge (PK), Technological Knowledge (TK), Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK), Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), Technological Content Knowledge (TCK), Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). This study involved 154 pre-service teachers from various programs such as a Bachelor's Degree in Education Majoring in Information Technology, Moral Education, Accounting and Business Management. Questionnaire forms were sent through a ‘Google Form’ to their respective emails and responses were analyzed using SPSS software. The findings showed that the pre-service teachers have a high level of competency, confidence and lastly TPACK.

From the intercultural communication perspective, every culture provides a particular view of leadership communication because each culture has tended to look at certain cultural conceptual artifacts differently. For example, in Asia, the studies on leadership communication tended to focus on Japanese and Korean and there are only a few studies which have used other cultural notions like the ones carried out in Malaysia. Among the challenges faced by the leaders in Malaysia are the ways to remain relevant in light of rapid changes in the country. The priority is, therefore, to be able sustain the impressive achievements made thus far in the rather challenging context of a multi-racial and multi-religious society, especially the need to understand the cultural thinking of the Chinese community after the recent General Election (GE13).

However, poverty in Malaysia is often referred to as absolute poverty income households compared with Poverty Line Income (PLI). This type of measurement, using the income method in identifying an individual or household poor also as a measurement of unidimension. In contrast to the unidimension measurement, measurement of poverty using the multidimensional poverty measure is no longer in use and not as a basic for policy makers to alleviate poverty. The measurement of multidimensional poverty is more on measures and identify ""who is poor"" based on the shortage experienced by households in each dimension. With this multidimensional poverty measurement, identity or characteristics of the poor exist on two levels or stages. The first stage is the identification of the individual in each dimension and the second involves the definition of poverty through all dimensions. Multidimensional poverty, is a new poverty measurement method that allows us to see a real shortage or reality of poverty experienced by a householder.","Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

BA keys vary from 32-448 bits to ensure a high level of security. However, the BA requires a high memory percentage and it has a problem regarding randomness of output with text and image files having large strings of identical bytes. One solution to the seissues is to design a new Cryptography algorithm based on the BA that incorporates an F-function into a Cylindrical Coordinate System (CCS). The resulting F-function is known as a CCS with a Dynamic Permutation Table (DPT) or CCSDPT whereas the new algorithm is called the New BA (NBA). The objectives of the CCSDPT are to reduce memory requirements, enhance the randomness of the output and increase resistance to attacks through byte relocation and transformation in the right cylinder. NBA is evaluated by investigates the output of the algorithm by using statistical tests from the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) with five types of data and compared with the BA. The findings of the NIST tests show that the NBA is suitable for any data stream, even those with long strings of identical bytes. The combination of a DPT with a dynamic 3D S-box strengthens the resistance of the NBA against attacks and increases the randomness of the output. C++ is used in the implementation of both algorithms.

However, soils microbes are very sensitive to changes in soil condition. The use of Biological Control Agents (BCAs) is regarded as a promising measure to control Basal Stem Rot (BSR) of oil palm disease. However, its potential effect on other soil microbes is not clear. This paper reports the impact application of two BCAs-based products in the soil microbial population and diversity on oil palm plantation soil. Isolation of microbes from the soil was carried out using plate counts techniques on various media such as Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA), Malt Extract Agar (MEA) and Nutrient Agar (NA). The presence of viable microbes on cultured media was observed and counted using Colony Forming Unit (CFU) method and later identified using Biolog and molecular techniques. The CFU for bacteria and yeast after application of these microbial treatments were remains unchanged, which varied between 10S to 106 cfu/g and 102 to 106 cfu/g of soil respectively. However, CFU for fungi has increased to 104 cfu/g of soil. Identification based on Biolog and molecular technique shows that new species arose and overcome the predominated species after application of these microbial products. The new identified species were Enterobacter spp., Microbacterium spp., Burkholderia spp., Yarrowia spp., Streptomyces spp., Trichoderma spp., etc. Application of BCAs to soil could possibly enhance the richness and evenness of microbial distribution in soil. © 2014 AENSI PUBLISHER All rights reserved.","Food Science, Agronomy and Crop Science, Horticulture","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The fragmentation process in traditional contracting practice further hinders the integration of construction knowledge among contractors, diminishing the opportunity for them to influence design decisions. When design professionals fail to consider as to how a contractor would construct the designed project results in scheduling problems, delays, and disputes during the construction process. Moving towards team integration is considered a significant strategy for overcoming the issue. Accordingly, this paper discusses the fragmentation issue in more detail including its definition, and causes and effects to the construction projects. It also explores that the team integration strategy alleviates scheduling problems, and helps avoid delays and disputes during the construction process, preventing harm to overall project performance. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

In Malaysia this technologically enhanced method is known as the Indutrialised Building System (IBS). Concerted efforts have been made for the past decade by various responsible parties especially by the government. Therefore, the IBS 'Road Map' 2003-2010 was introduced and now continues with the IBS 'road map' 2011-2015. However, its performance is still at its infancy, which target is only at an initial stage. This study seeks to identify and analyse the factor of the IBS' system's supply chain flexibility as a factor on the success of the system itself. It has been a suspicion that there exists a condition and situation where the supply chain is too rigid and is not flexible in fulfilling the needs and demands of the IBS development in Malaysia. This inflexible situation has brought about a broad range of problems and has stood in the way of the development of the industrialised building system, despite it being introduced since 1964, or 49 years ago. Flexibility in the IBS supply chain is very important and is associated with other industries like transportation, manufacturing industry, and others. Up until now, we have yet to discover any special studies related to the flexibility in the IBS supply chain in this country. Responding to this challenge, this research is hoped to be able to provide sufficient feedback to the solution to the IBS supply chain flexibility issue. The researcher is confident that the poor system flow of supply chain has impeded the advancement of the Industrialised Building System that has long been open to debate. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This research focuses on Nano-Biosensor, currently being researched in Malaysia, focusing on different components making up the Nano-Biosensor. Although research into the materials and the application of these materials is paramount to the growth of this promising industry, to enable it to be forecasted, monitored, and controlled, there must also be research into the feasibility and management of the industry. However, measuring the potential impact of a technology is basically a Collingridge dilemma-a double-bind problem: the impact of a technology cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and adopted, whilst the control or change of a technology is very difficult once it has been extensively developed and adopted. In order to address these issues, a technique called technology assessment (TA) has been developed to assist in evaluating these emerging technologies. Data were collected using a qualitative method performed on respondents actively involved in the development of new nanotechnology applications, related to Nano-Biosensors. Using convenience sampling, identified respondents located in a research institute of a local university, located in the Northern part of Malaysia, we selected as respondents. Several issues were uncovered and presented in the results of this paper.

These give top management better insight on how to develop attractive schemes as well as conducive working environment. In conclusion, these findings confirmed the relationship between motivational factors and employees' motivation. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Business and International Management","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The main objectives of this study are to identify Malaysian graduates' employability skills, to identify the priority of each skill and to highlight the gap between the importance of graduates' employability skills to employers and their level of satisfaction on those skills. In general, the results of the gap analysis showed that employers perceive graduates' employability skills performance as being lower than the importance assigned to those skills.

This paper analyses the liquidation law and issues in one of the failed residential projects in Malaysia, particularly the position of the secured creditor chargee and the purchasers. This paper finds that the secured creditor chargee of the liquidated housing developer company enjoys priority over the assets and moneys of the liquidated housing developer company, even at the expense of the aggrieved purchasers' interests. Owing to this, the rights of the purchasers are marginalised. Thus, following some analyses over the liquidation legal provisions and the housing law, this paper suggests certain proposals to improve the current state of law governing rehabilitation of failed residential projects in Malaysia to preserve the interests of the purchasers.

A hundred years of internationalization process has transformed MNC greatly due to the evolution of the motives and the way companies integrate and expand their business around the world. Rapid liberalization, globalization and technological change especially in information and communication technology (ICT) sector have again revolutionized the transformation of the MNCs even further. As a consequence, the traditional version of the ownership-specific, localization and internalization advantages O.L.I) paradigm and recent new theories of the MNCs are inadequate to explain the dynamics and the growing of the MNCs from developed and emerging economies. This paper argues that the traditional International Business Theories of MNCs should seek cooperation from an innovation perspective approach such as Rothwell's five generations of innovation process and open innovation approach proposed by Chesbrough in order to strengthen the theories of MNCs. Since both approaches emphasize the role of external factors such as the role of knowledge, expertise, university and networks which are lacking in the traditional resource-based theory. The combination of O.L.I paradigm and innovation approaches will certainly strengthen the capability of the MNCs theories to generalize about how MNCs from emerging economies are similar and dissimilar to more traditional MNCs from developed countries in the era of rapid globalization. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.","Philosophy, Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence","Handelshögskolan | Universiti Utara Malaysia","Gothenburg | Sintok","Sweden | Malaysia"

The parameters estimated by the proposed EM Algorithm scheme are close to the parameters of the postulated model. To investigate the consistency and stability of the EM scheme, the simulations are repeated several times. The repetitions of the simulation gave parameters closer to the values of postulated models, with relatively small standard errors.

Overall, the contributing factor to obesity varies. Lack of physical activity and increased sedentary behaviour has been identified as the causes of weight gain and various health implications including obesity. Rapid development in industrialization and urbanization has brought Malaysia to be the next millennium country in the world, and this causes changes in the country's socioeconomic, especially the lifestyles of Malaysians. In conjunction with this, the aim of this paper is to simulate the changes in physical activities and to highlight its implication on body weight and prevalence of overweight and obesity in a Malaysian adult population. This study combines different strands of knowledge consisting of nutrition, physical activity and body metabolism, and these elements have been synthesised into a system dynamics model called SIMULObese. The development of this model has considered the interrelations between those various strands in one multifaceted human weight regulation system. Findings from this study revealed that Malaysian adults perform less physical activity and this has resulted in weight gain and increase in prevalence of overweight and obesity. Therefore, findings from this study bring the important message to various parties such as practitioners, researchers, educators and publics about the importance of focusing on combinations of intensity, frequency and duration of moderate-vigorous activity for adult obesity control in Malaysia. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.","Physics and Astronomy (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Since the competitiveness within tourism industry is very high, many of the tour agents try to provide attractive tour-packages in order to meet tourist satisfaction as much as possible. Some of the criteria that are considered by the tourist are the number of places to be visited and the cost of the tour-packages. Previous studies indicate that tourists tend to choose economical tour-packages and aiming to visit as many places as they can cover. Thus, this study proposed tour-package model using heuristic approach. The aim is to find economical tour-packages and at the same time to propose as many places as possible to be visited by tourist in a given geographical area particularly in Langkawi Island. The proposed model considers only one starting point where the tour starts and ends at an identified hotel. This study covers 31 most attractive places in Langkawi Island from various categories of tourist attractions. Besides, the allocation of period for lunch and dinner are included in the proposed itineraries where it covers 11 popular restaurants around Langkawi Island. In developing the itinerary, the proposed heuristic approach considers time window for each site (hotel/restaurant/place) so that it represents real world implementation. We present three itineraries with different time constraints (1-day, 2-day and 3-day tour-package). The aim of economic model is to minimize the tour-package cost as much as possible by considering entrance fee of each visited place. We compare the proposed model with our uneconomic model from our previous study. The uneconomic model has no limitation to the cost with the aim to maximize the number of places to be visited. Comparison between the uneconomic and economic itinerary has shown that the proposed model have successfully achieved the objective that minimize the tour cost and cover maximum number of places to be visited. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.","Physics and Astronomy (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The principal component analysis was used to determine the best items across their factors and the measurement model for the model-fit as well as indicators and predictors. The path analysis was applied to know the direct-effect of the exogenous on endogenous variables. From the results of factor analysis, it shows that the 'teaching load' factor seemed to have the highest item loading followed by the 'salary' and the 'promotion/recognition' also had very strong items loadings that should be fairly considered. CFA tests also confirmed the same results where the issues related to teaching are the first factors followed by the salary and the promotion that led to the teachers' turnover and dissatisfaction. The path analysis indicated a direct causality of teaching load and promotion on turnover.

However, this test is easily affected by any deviation in normality, more obvious when heterogeneity of variances and group sizes exist. It is well known that the violation in the assumption of these tests will lead to inflation in Type I error rate and depression in statistical test power. In mitigating the problem, robust methods can be used as alternatives. One such method is H-statistic. When used with modified one-step M-estimator (MOM), this test statistic (MOM-H) produce good control of Type I error even under small sample size but inconsistent across certain conditions investigated. Furthermore, power of the test is low which might be due to the trimming process. In this study, MOM is winsorized (WMOM) to sustain the original sample size. The H-statistic with WMOM as the central tendency measures (denoted as WMOM-H) showed better control of Type I error as compared to MOM-H especially under balance design regardless of the shapes of distribution investigated in the study. It also performed well under highly skewed and heavy tailed distribution for unbalanced design. In general, this study demonstrated that winsorization process (WMOM) could improve the performance of H-statistic in terms of Type I error rate control. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.","Physics and Astronomy (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

However, changes in customers' requirements have triggered the need to design other alternatives of the manufacturing layout for existing production floor. Hence, this paper discusses effective alternatives of the process layout specifically, the conveyor system layout. Subsequently, two alternative designs for the conveyor system were proposed with the aims to increase the production output and minimize space allocation. The first proposed layout design includes the installation of conveyor oven in the particular manufacturing room based on priority, and the second one is the one without the conveyor oven in the layout. Simulation technique was employed to design the new facility layout. Eventually, simulation experiments were conducted to understand the performance of each conveyor layout design based on operational characteristics, which include predicting the output of layouts. Utilizing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the newly and improved layout designs were assessed before the final selection was done. As a comparison, the existing conveyor system layout was included in the assessment process. Relevant criteria involved in this layout design problem were identified as (i) usage of space of each design, (ii) operator's utilization rates, (iii) return of investment (ROI) of the layout, and (iv) output of the layout. In the final stage of AHP analysis, the overall priority of each alternative layout was obtained and thus, a selection for final use by the management was made based on the highest priority value. This efficient planning and designing of facility layout in a particular manufacturing setting is able to minimize material handling cost, minimize overall production time, minimize investment in equipment, and optimize utilization of space. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.","Physics and Astronomy (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The main result shows that as the number of firm increases, the equilibrium in the first system becomes unstable when the number of firms is greater than four, while in the second system, there is a change in the region of stability for the equilibrium. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.","Physics and Astronomy (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The classical approaches such as ttest for two groups and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for more than two groups always are favorable selection by researchers. However, sometime these methods were abused by the presence of nonnormality or variance heterogeneity or both. It is known that ANOVA is restricted to the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance. In real life data, sometimes these requirements are hard to attain. The Alexander-Govern test with adaptive trimmed mean (AG-atm) is one approach that can be chosen as alternative to the classical tests when their assumptions are violated. In this paper, the performances of AG-atm were compared to the original AG test and ANOVA using simulated and real life data. The simulation study proved that the AG-atm performs better than the original AG test and the classical test. For real life data, student's performance in decision analysis course, measured by final examination score was chosen. Based on the exploratory data analysis, this data found to have problem of nonnormality. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.","Physics and Astronomy (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Based on central limit theorem, the normality assumption is fulfilled with large data set, but getting large data set is not always feasible. Most of the time, the researchers have to make do with small sample sizes which are hardly normally distributed. There are many causes of non normality, and one of it is the presence of outliers. One way to handle outliers is by using robust estimator with trimming approach. In this study, robust estimators using different trimming approaches namely adaptive and automatic trimming were proposed as the center measures in Alexander-Govern (AG) test. The results of the Type I error rate was then compared with the original AG test and the classical t-test. The AG test with the adaptive and automatic trimming showed robustness across distributions.

The computation of this test is simple yet it is powerful under normal distribution and equal variance dataset. However, in real life data, sometimes it is hard to get dataset which has this package. The violation of assumptions (normality and equal variances) will give the devastating effect on the Type I error rate control to the t-test. On the same time, the statistical power also will be reduced. Therefore in this study, the adaptive Winsorised mean with hinge estimator in H-statistic (AWM-H) is proposed. The H-statistic is one of the robust statistics that able to handle the problem of nonnormality in comparing independent group. This procedure originally used Modified One-step M (MOM) estimator which employed trimming process. In the AWM-H procedure, the MOM estimator is replaced with the adaptive Winsorized mean (AWM) as the central tendency measure of the test.

Some researchers would consider that the procedures with conservative Type I error rates fail to perform. However, other researchers may assume otherwise, such that any value less than or equal to the nominal level can still be considered as robust. Many quantitative measures or criteria can be used to evaluate the robustness of a statistical test such as the t-test.

This study aims to build an index crime which is specific to vehicle theft. The development of vehicle theft index proposed in this study requires three main steps; the first involves identification of criteria related to vehicle theft, the second requires calculation of degrees of importance, or weighting criteria, which involves application of correlation and entropy methods, and the final involves building of vehicle theft index using method of linear combination, or weighted arithmetic average.

PFS is increasingly used as a primary endpoint in evaluation of patients with solid tumors, while multiple endpoints are often analysed independently. These endpoints are indeed correlated and it is desirable to evaluate effectiveness of treatments by means of a single parameter. In this paper, a single overall treatment effect is provided by combining the univariate score statistics for comparing treatments with respect to each survival endpoint. This global score test methodology was applied in analysis of 330 patients with an aggressive cancer, each with two endpoints recorded, T1 and T2, relating to disease progression and death respectively. The values of score statistics obtained from the proposed method matched closely those from the logrank test. Meanwhile, the correlations between the two score test statistics were found to be similar to those computed using the established Wei, Lin and Weissfeld method.

To ensure success in interpersonal intelligence, several criteria can well predict people's quotient. These are the ability to understand students, the ability to grasp people/students' ability to clearly establish thoughts and feelings, ability to ask and offer feedback, ability to serve as a determinant to how others act and think, ability to engage in and resolve conflicts, and, ability to work with others effectively.

The results support the main hypotheses for the study, suggesting that Iraqi HEIs can benefit from TQM practices. Pearson correlation points out that all practices of TQM have significant correlations with OKC. Regression analyses show significant positive relationships. Additionally, statistical analysis also indicates that the TQM practices should be implemented collectively rather than individually. In conclusion, this study provides insight and further understanding of the effect of TQM practices on OKC, and therefore, allows practitioners to get in-depth knowledge about the impact of TQM practices in Iraqi HEIs context.","Business and International Management, Accounting","University of Kufa","Kufa","Iraq"

Taking into account the various levels of knowledge and technological capabilities in water management, the framework is developed based on the commonly known 3R approach in environmental management, with the addition of another R (Reaching). It is proposed that hotels can innovate and enhance their water management approaches under these 4Rs: Innovative Reducing, Innovative Reusing, Innovative Reaching and Innovative Recycling. The framework offers examples and strategies about how hotels of different sizes, with differing financial, technical, knowledge and managerial capacities could address the challenge of implementing water management and obtain commercial benefit.

Several studies have highlighted the application of prefabrication construction or Industrialised Building Systems (IBS) as a catalyst for increased sustainability in building structures. However, it should be noted that there are some hesitation in the adoption of this method. Many clients in the Malaysian construction industry have negative perceptions in IBS as they are often poorly informed on IBS design, unable to foresee the benefits of this innovative method and unaware of its relevance to sustainability. It is crucial for the stakeholders of the construction industry to educate the clients on the advantages of IBS as well as establishing a comprehensive business model in implementing IBS to increase the confidence of the clients in the adoption of IBS. A radical improvement in the procurement system and supply chain process towards a more integrated approach is needed in order to achieve IBS success in the Malaysian construction industry. Although there are many related studies concentrated in this area and attempts to improve construction business process that based on team integration approach such as partnering, concurrent engineering etc, however these studies specifically provide any guideline on how to achieve a successful business towards that approach. It is therefore, the aim of this research to develop a business model for Malaysian IBS through the integrated team approach. The process of early involvement approach in this model will be clearly highlighted that including the detail explanation of criteria team/stakeholders selection process for an IBS project. With the development of this business model, the stakeholders in the Malaysian construction industry will have more guidelines in practice and their efforts in implementing IBS will be more structured towards successful project delivery. © 2014 AENSI PUBLISHER All rights reserved.","Food Science, Agronomy and Crop Science, Horticulture","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This traditional construction process has been widely criticized for its fragmented approach to project delivery and its failure to form effective teams. Due to that problem, a number of issues have recently arisen in current construction methods, such as reworks, time delay, rising costs, lack of communication and coordination, and wastages.

In particular, the paper throws its light on the principle features of the board of directors, i.e. board independence, CEO duality, financial expertise, governance expertise, firm-specific expertise and size. In this paper, a cross-sectional version of the Modified Jones Model is applied to ensure the accurate assessment of the key impacts of board characteristics on EM for a sample of 86 industrial listed companies on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) for the years 2008 to 2010. Discretionary accruals are used as proxy for EM. This study, on the basis of findings, reveals the significant correlation between salient board features and EM. Findings of this systematic observation demonstrate that board independence, financial expertise, governance expertise and size have a negative relation with EM. It also found that CEO duality and board firm-specific expertise have an obvious positive relation with discretionary accruals. The findings suggested that the board character has an effective role in detecting EM and in turn improve financial reporting quality (FRQ). In real fields, the discoveries of this paper portray valuable information for the regulators in different countries. The results also provide useful information for investors in assessing the impact of board characteristics on FRQ. In fact, previous studies on this very issue in this context do not meet the demand of comprehensive observation appropriately. To make input in this area, particularly among Jordanian companies, this study will extend the scope through providing empirically tested findings of the role of board directors' characteristics on EM. In addition, this paper is the first empirical study to investigate the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and EM in Jordan.","Business, Management and Accounting (all)","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia | Abu Dhabi University","Sintok | Abu Dhabi","Malaysia | United Arab Emirates"

Our analyses demonstrate how the various types of livelihood assets contribute to household income of fishers in different types of water body areas such as closed beels (deeper depressions in the floodplain), open beels (lake), floodplain beels and rivers. Data for the study were obtained from two questionnaire-based field surveys conducted by the Bangladesh CBFM project office: a baseline study carried out in 2002 and an impact study in mid-2006. A total of 1994 households were randomly selected from 34 (51%) CBFM project water bodies in Bangladesh. Our study shows that fisher's income has significantly increased in floodplain beels (FPB), open beels (OB), and rivers. Fishers' income from fishing has been significantly reduced in closed beels (CB) due to excessive lease fees and stocking costs for aquaculture. The regression results indicate that natural, physical, and financial assets have significantly contributed to income of the fisher households in open beels, rivers, and floodplain beels. The CBFM organized fishers have changed their attitudes, improved trust, and resolved conflicts in open beels. Results of the study suggest that natural, physical, and financial assets play very significant roles in poverty reduction in CBFM areas in Bangladesh.

This has encouraged economists worldwide to consider alternative financial solutions and attention has been focused on Islamic banking and finance as an alternative model. Hence, this study examines the efficiency level of Islamic banks during the financial crisis specifically in Middle Eastern and Asian countries from 2007 to 2010. Moreover, bank-specific and risk factors were examined to understand the determinants of efficiency. The efficiency of Islamic banks is measured using data envelopment analysis by adopting the intermediation approach. The financial information is extracted from BankScope database for a four year period (2007-2010) which includes 79 Islamic banks across a number of countries. The study also critically analyses pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency of the Islamic banks in Middle Eastern and Asian countries and estimates their return to scale. The findings explain that Islamic banks were able to sustain operations through the crisis. However, the study also shows that the majority of these Islamic banks were scale inefficient. Most of the scale inefficient banks were operating at decreasing returns to scale. This study also found that both profitability and capitalisation were the main determinants of Islamic banking efficiency. Hence, the findings of this study have policy implications and make a contribution to policy-making by providing empirical evidence on the performance of the Islamic banks and their efficiency levels. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Finance, Economics and Econometrics","N/A","N/A","N/A"

Farmers in developing countries do not make use of all the potential technological resources, thus making inefficient decisions in their agricultural activities. Herein, technical efficiency in relation with the production of three types of rice crop (Boro, Aus and Aman) was evaluated, with some determinants of technical efficiency identified, in Bangladesh. It was attempted, throughout this study, to access the status of technical efficiency in rice production in Bangladesh for panel data while using the Stochastic Frontier Production Model with either of truncated normal or half-normal distributional assumptions. Both time-variant and time-invariant inefficiency effects models were estimated, one at a time. Collected data from agricultural sector pertaining to three main rice crops in Bangladesh for the period of 1980 to 2008 were made used of throughout the study. The results revealed that technical efficiency gradually increased over the reference period with the half normal distribution being found preferable to the truncated normal distribution as regards the technical inefficiency effects. The value of technical efficiency was found high for Boro rice while low for Aus in comparison with Aman rice in Bangladesh for both distributions in either of time-variant or invariant ones. It was observed that the most efficient rice production system has occurred for the case of Boro with a technical efficiency of 0.98.

Specifically, our paper examined the impact of ethnic diversity groups on the boards of directors and audit committees in terms of earnings forecast accuracy. We are motivated by the lack of prior studies related to investigating IPO earnings forecast. Cross-sectional Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) modeling was conducted on 190 Malaysian IPOs from 2002 to 2012. For the evaluation of earnings forecast accuracy, we mathematically used the metric of Absolute Forecast Error (AFER). Moreover, for the test of robustness, we used the metric of Squared Forecast Error (SQFER) as error measurement, as it mostly deals with large errors. The empirical results indicate that the ethnic diversity groups on boards and audit committees have an impact on the accuracy of earnings forecasts. However, the evidence is significant for Chinese and Malay serving on boards but insignificant in terms of Chinese and Malay serving on audit committee. The findings indicate that multi-ethnic groups in Malaysian IPO companies could hinder the capability of IPO companies to achieve accurate earnings forecasts in their prospectuses. © 2014 Penerbit UTM Press.

In fact, these demands are increasing the pressure on Information Technology in order to ensure that data will be delivered properly at the right time and faster rate. In this paper, we propose to build a virtual data mart, especially for Organizational KPIs by using data virtualization technology, which can be used to help KPI developers to build and update performance management system quickly and make these systems work in real time. In this paper, we present a way of identifying and building virtual data marts for Organizational KPIs. The basic principle underlying the proposed approach is that the design of virtual data marts should be driven by the business needs and organizational requirements that each virtual data mart is expected to address. As a consequence, the virtual data mart design process must be based on a deep understanding of the top management's need and users' expectations.

Malaysia and Canada have some common sociological aspects such as the size of population, the ratio of indigenous people and immigrants, and multilingual contexts. It also has in common various core elements in the set of criteria proposed by Swain and Johnson (1997) to define a prototypical immersion program. Thus, the lessons Canadians have learned from immersion may be seen as significant guiding light for TeSME and other attempts of content-based instruction programs. Canadian immersion has been different from TeSME at least in terms of three core features: overt support exists for the L1; the teachers are bilingual; and the classroom culture is that of the local L1 community. These differences made four issues more prominent: Learning outcome of TeSME; mainstay of TeSME; judicious use of L1; and function of TeSME. Finally some suggestions are proposed: give higher priority to promoting concept development across languages for now; make English classes more effective; promote bilingualism in TeSME; and extend TeSME's function to understanding and integrating other cultures and languages. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Geography, Planning and Development, Communication, Business, Management and Accounting (all), Economics and Econometrics","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Furthermore, the increase in awareness on environmental issues, sustainable development, corporate citizenship and the benefit of recycling had also placed more pressure on firms to adopt sustainable business initiatives such as a better reverse logistics strategy. Manufacturing firms however often focused on forward logistics and as a result, they tend to overlook at the importance of reverse logistics activities and its potential of improving the firm's performance. The objective of this study is to look at the current level of reverse logistics adoption among manufacturers in Malaysia and to identify the influence of customer/stakeholder pressure, regulatory pressure, financial and competitive pressure, and corporate citizenship pressure on the level of reverse logistics adoption. In addition, this study also aims to determine the relationship between reverse logistics adoption level and firm's performance. Data was collected through survey questionnaire, and the respondents consist of managers at manufacturing firms located in the Northern State of Malaysia and the Klang Valley. 101 samples were collected and data analysis was conducted using the Partial Least Square (PLS) regression analysis, through SmartPLS 2.0 software. Findings indicate that the level of reverse logistics adoption among Malaysia manufacturers is considerably low. Out of four independent variables, only the regulatory pressure has a significantly strong influence on the level of reverse logistics adoption, while customer and stakeholder pressure has a significant but moderate influence.

The aims of this paper are threefold. First, it investigates the impact of surplus free cash flows (SFCF) on earnings predictability. Second, it investigates whether corporate governance variables moderate the negative impact of SFCF on earnings predictability. Finally, this study examines whether the ability of corporate governance to mitigate SFCF and improve the predictive value of earnings varies between large and small firms. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses heteroskedasticity-corrected least square regressions upon a sample of Malaysian listed firms. Findings - This paper finds that firms with high SFCF experience less earnings predictability. It also indicates that earnings of firms with high SFCF are more predictable when institutional investors hold a large stake of shares and when a chairperson is independent. Finally, this paper reveals that the role of institutional and managerial ownership in mitigating agency conflict of free cash flow and improving earnings predictability is more prominent in larger firms. This study implies that investors still have reservations about the ability of boards to enhance earnings numbers in Malaysia, although efforts were taken to reform the corporate governance mechanisms following the Asian financial crisis. Originality/value - This research is considered as the first attempt to examine the relationships between SFCF, corporate governance, firm size, and earnings predictability in a developing county such as Malaysia. The findings of this paper serve as a wake-up call to policy makers to evaluate the importance of governance structure in enhancing earnings predictability in emerging economies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Management Information Systems, Accounting, Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

To determine the relationship between these factors and their influence on training transfer and to test the model, the researchers collected data from employees in the Malaysian banking sector. Structural equation modeling with Amos 16 was used to test the model and determine the relationship. The study suggested that training stakeholders should manage the training program effectively. Transfer is maximized when trainees have social support, high performance self-efficacy, and transfer motivation. Stakeholders (e.g., trainers, trainees, supervisors, and peers) are important to the training transfer process, as are learner readiness, trainee reaction, instrumentality, and training retention. This study revealed that perceived content validity and transfer design work together and influence the trainee's performance self-efficacy. In other words, if trainers want to improve the performance self-efficacy level of trainees, they need to explain how the trainee can transfer the learned skills at the workplace and make sure the content of the training is similar to the actual job. The main objective of training programs is to align the employee's expertise with organizational goals. Organizations can achieve their desired objectives only when employees transfer the learned skills on the job. Unfortunately, employees often transfer only a small percentage of skills they have learned in training. To effectively manage their training programs, organizations need to identify and focus on the factors that resist effective training transfer. © 2014 International Society for Performance Improvement.","Education, Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This paper proposes a Firefly algorithm that is based on Newton's law of universal gravitation, known as Gravitation Firefly Algorithm (GFA), for document clustering. GFA is used to find centers of clusters based on objective function that maximizes the force between each document and an initial center. Upon identification of a center, the algorithm then locates documents that are similar to the center using cosine similarity function. The process of finding centers for new clusters continues by sorting the light intensity values of the balance documents.

Design/methodology/approach: This study was carried out using a cross-sectional survey approach. Subjects comprised 438 undergraduate students from six universities in Malaysia. Findings: Given strong support for the extended TPB's application to dietary supplements consumption provided by the study, it seems feasible that desirable changes in attitude, social norms, and perceptions of control might lead to corresponding changes in behavioural intention. The empirical findings, which are based on multi-group analysis, show that the strength of the relationships between informational influence, consumer attitude, and their intention to consume dietary supplements are strongly influenced by health motivation. Practical implications: This research sets the ground for stakeholders in the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors to improve their understanding of what drives dietary supplements consumption. Armed with this knowledge, marketers and health professionals could plan and execute their marketing strategies and health interventions more effectively.

One contributing factor is the ignorance of dot.com companies on the consumer needs in their website development. Furthermore, consumers' perspectives are often ignored in e-commerce website evaluations. This paper presents a framework for e-commerce quality and evaluation based on consumer perspectives. The framework consists of four components: e-commerce quality metrics, assessment entity, assessment specification and quality level. In order to illustrate the practicality of the framework, a case study on six Malaysian B2C e-commerce websites has been conducted. The findings show the framework is applicable and realistic. The successful implementation of the framework shows that it offers a guidance and standard procedure for e-commerce website quality evaluation that can be used to improve organization websites to meet the consumer need and to keep the organization competitive and sustainable. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","Management of Technology and Innovation","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Nonetheless, in Malaysia more stringent lock-up term is imposed on riskier firms that the provision should contribute positively to IPO performance as postulated in risk-return trade-off theory. Since signaling is more prevalent when information asymmetry is high, its effect needs to be considered when examining the relationship between lock-up provision and initial returns in a developing market like Malaysia. Using a sample of 375 IPOs listed on Bursa Malaysia from 2000 to 2012, this study examines the information asymmetry effect by creating sub-samples based on Fama-French's size factor. Results show that lock-up period is significantly positive in influencing IPO initial returns. Further analyses however indicate that the finding is more consistent with quality rather than risk hypothesis. Since there is barely any difference in the effect of lock-up variables on IPOs of small versus big firms, this study concludes that evidence of effect of information asymmetry hypothesis is yet to be established. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group.","Sociology and Political Science","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of personality traits (big five) on expatriates adjustment and job performance. Design/methodology/approach - In this regards, data were collected from 201 expatriates working in Malaysia and analyzed by using structural equation modelling with Amos 16. Findings - The findings of this study indicated that personality traits (big five) which include extroversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism positively influence expatriate adjustment which further influence expatriate performance rated by peers. In other words, expatriates adjustment (work, interaction, and general) mediate the relationship between big five personality traits (extroversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism) and expatriates job performance (task, relationship building, and overall performance). Research limitations/ implications - The findings of this study will help the researchers to further understand the importance of personality traits required for successful completion of international assignment. Furthermore, the findings also suggest human resource professionals to consider these personality traits before selecting an individual for international assignment. Finally, future research directions have been proposed. Originality/value - Literature on expatriate adjustment and job performance is still at developing stage.

The mapping of standardized multicriteria and risk factors were prepared through content analysis. As a result, there are eight criteria for tender evaluation which includes offered price, contractor credibility, processing time, contractor capability, contractor support service, employee capability, technical solution and document completeness. The risk factors were also defined by determining the risks that might have influence on project success.

Very few studies have been conducted in the South East Asia region regarding this issue. Thus, this survey was conducted to investigate the software practitioners' practices and perceptions on the software certification and its implementation in real-world projects. For data collection, structured questionnaire was used, whilst for data analysis simple statistical methods which are frequency and cross tabulation were utilized. The findings from this study revealed that software certification is needed to enhance the quality of produced software. One of the reasons is that the software practitioners are neglecting good software development practices, which directly influences the quality of produced software. Thus, by conducting software certification, the customers will be more confident with the quality of software produced for them, as it involves independent assessment. Therefore, it prolonged the needs of our study in constructing a process based software certification model. Consequently, the outcomes of this study will contribute to the development of the proposed model. © 2014 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Computer Science (all), Health (social science), Mathematics (all), Education, Environmental Science (all), Engineering (all), Energy (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

In this study, we assume that the shrinking velocity and wall temperature have specific exponential function form. An appropriate similarity transformation is employed to transform the governing equations in partial differential equations form to similarity equations in ordinary differential equations form. The resulting equations are then solved numerically using shooting technique with Maple implementation. The influence of mixed convection/buoyancy parameter λ, suction parameter s and shrinking variable c/a on the flow and heat transfer characteristics is examined and discussed. Numerical results indicate that the presence of buoyancy force would contribute to the presence of triple solutions to the flow and heat transfer for particular value of pertinent parameters. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We invoke a normalisation strategy for each parameter in order to generalise the specific problem data. Two graph coloring heuristics were used in this study (largest degree and saturation degree). A score for the difficulty of assigning each examination was obtained from an adaptive linear combination of these two heuristics and examinations in the list were ordered based on this value. The examinations with the score value representing the higher difficulty were chosen for scheduling based on two strategies. We tested for single and multiple heuristics with and without a heuristic modifier with different combinations of weight values for each parameter on the Toronto and ITC2007 benchmark data sets. We observed that the combination of multiple heuristics with a heuristic modifier offers an effective way to obtain good solution quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach delivers promising results. We conclude that this adaptive linear combination of heuristics is a highly effective method and simple to implement.
