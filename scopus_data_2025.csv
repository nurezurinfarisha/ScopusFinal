Applying a quantitative approach, the research utilizes panel data analysis from 2011 to 2021 on 89 developing countries, incorporating sources such as the UNDP Human Development Index and the Financial Inclusion Index. The findings highlight that insufficient investment in education can significantly constrain individuals’ capacity to engage with formal financial services, emphasizing the crucial role of financial literacy and skill-building initiatives. The result shows that, while financial accessibility initiatives have made progress, lack of education and weak governance structures continue to hinder financial reach for marginalized populations. Moreover, the study reveals that improvements in governance amplify the benefits of human capital on financial inclusion, creating a more conducive environment for banking institutions and digital financial platforms. This interaction indicates that both structural and policy-level barriers must be addressed concurrently to break the cycle of ineffective financial reach. The outcome of the study implies that targeted educational investment and robust governance measures are indispensable for sustainable economic development. By prioritizing skill enhancement and institutional stability, countries can advance more inclusive financial systems, encourage higher trust in formal financial products, and leverage funds more effectively. Ultimately, the study highlights the strategic importance of comprehensive educational policies and governance reforms as a pathway to achieving broader financial inclusion and enhanced socio-economic welfare.","Geography, Planning and Development, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (miscellaneous), Energy (miscellaneous)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This study investigates the effect of green finance on sustainable performance while exploring the moderating roles of financial technology (FinTech) adoption and digital transformation in this relationship. Using a survey of 152 employees from Saudi banks, data were analyzed using hierarchical regression with the PROCESS Macro tool. The results confirm a positive relationship between green finance and sustainable performance. In addition, FinTech adoption significantly moderates this relationship, enhancing the effectiveness of green finance. Importantly, the three-way interaction analysis reveals that digital transformation acts as a second-order moderator, as it strengthens the moderating effect of FinTech in the green finance–sustainable performance relationship. These results offer valuable insights into how digital capabilities condition the effectiveness of green finance in emerging economies. For policymakers and financial institutions, the findings highlight the importance of integrating digital tools and infrastructure to fully harness the benefits of green finance, where they suggest that the adoption of advanced financial technologies in conjunction with digital transformation can enhance sustainable performance, particularly in economies undergoing digital and environmental transitions, such as Saudi Arabia.","Geography, Planning and Development, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (miscellaneous), Energy (miscellaneous)","Taiz University | Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University","Taiz | Aurangabad","Yemen | India"

The adoption of barcode payment systems, also known as Quick Response (QR) code payments in Nigeria's transportation sector remains low despite the introduction of the New Quick Response (NQR) payment solution by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). This study investigates the factors influencing the adoption of barcode payment systems among road travelers in Nigeria. A survey of 500 road travelers was conducted using a structured questionnaire, and the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. The independent variables considered were cost, convenience, security, simplicity of use, and awareness. The regression model revealed that simplicity of use, convenience, security, and awareness were significant predictors of adoption, while cost had a positive but statistically insignificant effect. The study highlights that while awareness of barcode payment systems is relatively high (70 %), actual adoption is low (30 %). These findings suggest that despite awareness efforts, more focused interventions are required to address barriers such as security concerns and user experience. Future research could explore the adoption of barcode payment systems in other sectors and examine the role of government policies in promoting digital payments. This study contributes to the understanding of technology adoption in Nigeria's transportation sector, with practical implications for policymakers, transportation operators, and financial institutions aiming to enhance the use of digital payment systems.","Sociology and Political Science, Management Science and Operations Research, Management of Technology and Innovation","Federal University, Kashere | College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Gombe | Sintok","Nigeria | Malaysia"

The HNN-RANkSAT model combines Boolean logic-based satisfiability with the Lyapunov energy function of HNNs to extract logical relationships and identify critical features for COVID-19 dataset classification. Evaluated against Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the model’s performance was assessed using Accuracy, Hamming Loss, Cross-Entropy Loss, CPU Time, and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). HNN-RANkSAT achieves the highest accuracy of 95.0% at sample size = 500, outperforming RF with 95.0%, SVM with 94.0%, and LR with 93.0% accuracy. It also exhibits the lowest Hamming Loss of 0.04 and Cross-Entropy Loss of 0.16, demonstrating superior classification performance and probabilistic calibration. The model’s logical constraints refine the search space, reducing misclassification errors and improving confidence estimation. However, this comes at the cost of higher computational complexity, with CPU Time increasing to 60 s at 1000 sample size, compared to LR with 20 s, RF with 40 s, and SVM with 50 s. The BIC values for HNN-RANkSAT at 170 sample size is 1000 reflect its greater model complexity, justified by its robustness in structured problem domains. Statistical tests, including McNemar’s test and Wilcoxon Rank test, confirm the model’s significant improvements (p-values < 0.05), with a large Cohen’s d effect size of 1.21. The hybrid architecture, integrating logic-based reasoning with neural network learning, enables HNN-RANkSAT to handle noisy, incomplete, and high-dimensional data effectively, making it ideal for medical classification tasks. While Random Forest offers a balanced alternative for large-scale problems, HNN-RANkSAT excels in high-precision tasks like pandemic surveillance.","Computational Mathematics, Applied Mathematics","Isa Kaita College of Education | Universiti Utara Malaysia","Dutsin-Ma | Sintok","Nigeria | Malaysia"

A qualitative longitudinal multiple-case study was conducted with 12 novice EFL teachers from four public universities in China. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, emotion diaries, reflective journals and work reports for two academic semesters. Afterwards, data were analysed using a systematic iterative approach involving verbatim transcription, thematic coding with NVivo 12 and categorisation based on cognitive appraisals. The findings reveal that novice EFL teachers consistently experience anger, anxiety and frustration, though their intensity and appraisal strategies evolve over time. Novice teachers initially perceive challenges as threats, gradually develop coping mechanisms, and reframe difficulties as opportunities. These findings underscore the necessity of creating support mechanisms tailored to each career stage. The implications for novice EFL teachers, teacher educators, school leaders and policymakers are also discussed.","Education","Baoding University | Universiti Utara Malaysia","Baoding | Sintok","China | Malaysia"

These credentials offer flexibility, targeted and tailored learning experiences that fill specific skill gaps while preparing learners for job roles. In the hope of capitalizing on the advantages of this flexible education, higher education institutions in Malaysia are increasingly adopting micro-credentials. Although all micro-credentials offered in Malaysia’s higher education institutes must conform to the Malaysian Qualifications Agency’s standards and regulations, the set-ups and implementation, however, are flexible depending on the institution’s ecosystem. As micro-credentials are relatively new in Malaysia and the references to success stories are usually from overseas universities, which have different settings and environment. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive overview of micro-credentials implementation in the context of Malaysian higher education institutions. This study adopted a qualitative case studies approach on three universities in Malaysia, which represent the public and private universities with different micro-credentials implementation competence. Collation of insights, which includes comparisons on the composition of the working committee, sustainability strategies, and collaboration efforts are documented. An elaborate suggestion for micro-credentials newcomers is also included in this study through a proposed core team composition and detailed implementation pathway.

It is well known for its attractive leaf variations, earning it the nickname ""Queen of Leaves."" However, unpredictable price fluctuations make investing in Aglaonema speculative and high-risk. This research aims to predict the price of Aglaonema over the next five years using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. LSTM is considered superior to other algorithms in handling time series data. The model's performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on a weekly Aglaonema price dataset covering the period from January 2012 to December 2023. The results demonstrate that the LSTM algorithm can predict Aglaonema prices with high accuracy, as indicated by the following metrics: MSE: 0.005 – Represents the average squared difference between predicted and actual prices. A lower MSE indicates higher model accuracy. RMSE: 0.07-RMSE provides a more interpretable error measurement as it retains the same units as the original data. A low RMSE signifies that the model's predictions closely align with actual values. MAE: 0.04 – Measures the absolute average difference between predicted and actual prices. A lower MAE value reflects a smaller prediction error. Thus, this research makes a significant contribution to the development of a machine learning-based price prediction system for the ornamental plant industry.","Computer Science (miscellaneous), Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Information Systems","Universitas Islam Negeri Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta | IPB University","South Tangerang | Bogor","Indonesia | Indonesia"

Due to the limited number of reviews, sentiment analysis struggles to determine whether negative news significantly affects tourists’ emotions and visitor numbers. This study employs empirical data to validate its impact, clarifying its actual influence on image discrepancy and tourist arrivals. Additionally, while managing image discrepancy is acknowledged as important in tourism, academic debate persists regarding whether negative news contributes to these discrepancies. This study conducted in-depth interviews with 30 participants, comprising 18 individual attendees and 12 attendees from 4 small seminars. Participants included recent visitors to Malaysia, prospective tourists who canceled their plans, and Malaysian tourism practitioners. Using the Context-Adaptive Grounded Theory (CAGT) methodology, the study explored whether sudden negative news events significantly influence Chinese tourists’ travel decisions and identified specific factors contributing to the discrepancy between Chinese tourists’ perceptions of Malaysia’s tourism image and the image projected by Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs). The findings revealed that negative news was not the dominant factor driving image discrepancy. Instead, cultural differences—stemming from unclear understanding of religious and local cultures, as well as language barriers—were the primary causes. Additionally, inefficiencies in DMOs’ promotion of Malaysia’s multi-ethnic identity and an overemphasis on medical tourism, which failed to attract Chinese tourists, were identified as secondary factors. This study provides valuable insights into the complex impact of sudden events on tourism and offers guidance for Destination Management Organizations to better align projected and perceived destination images to facilitate tourism recovery.","Multidisciplinary","Suzhou Industrial Park Institute of Vocational Technology | Universiti Utara Malaysia","Suzhou | Sintok","China | Malaysia"

The results were displayed by the counts of cultural elements. The data revealed that international cultures and source cultures were highlighted, and the textbooks were not oriented toward native-speakers’ English. Moreover, the distribution of cultural categories across the textbooks remains imbalanced, with cultural products occupying the largest proportion, and cultural perspectives displayed the least. This is mainly attributed to the fact that cultural perspectives are implicit cultures under the surface of the iceberg, and notably, they are sporadically reflected by the cultural products, practices, and persons. The findings provide suggestions that writers include balanced cultural elements in compiling English language teaching textbooks, and teachers scrutinize cultural representation and design intercultural activities.","Computer Science (miscellaneous), Education, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation, Developmental and Educational Psychology, Public Administration, Computer Science Applications","Hubei University of Science and Technology | Universiti Utara Malaysia","Xianning | Sintok","China | Malaysia"

To address this gap, this study conducted at the Sanxingdui Archeological Site Museum employs the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), a widely used framework for analyzing user acceptance of technology, alongside structural equation modeling to examine the nuanced interplay of Technology Readiness dimensions and their impact on perceptions. The findings reveal that optimism does not significantly influence attitudes toward AR, while innovativeness has a positive effect. Discomfort is negatively associated with AR attitudes, while perceived security concerns have a counterintuitive positive effect. Moreover, perceived ease of use strongly determines the perceived usefulness of AR, which, in turn, directly influences attitudes toward the technology. Perceived ease of use also plays a crucial role in shaping AR attitudes. Additionally, a positive attitude toward AR is strongly linked to future adoption intentions, which, in turn, significantly correlate with tourists’ intentions to visit destinations.

It sought to evaluate domestic violence among Syrian refugee girls married before 18 and its impact on these young girls and their families. The long-lasting displacement caused by the internal Syrian war has led to one of the world’s largest refugee populations. The qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with young wives using ecological theory as a conceptual framework. Face-to-face interviews were conducted by the first author with four girls, along with focus group discussions involving five parents. Purposive and snowball sampling methods were employed for participant selection. The primary findings highlighted that conflicts with parents-in-law are associated with domestic violence and divorce incidents affecting family members of Syrian refugees. Domestic violence within a family leads to marital breakdowns and subsequent legal issues due to divorces. Hence, suitable strategies such as engaging in social work with young wives and their families can help reduce marital violence prevalence among refugees. Furthermore, it is recommended that parents educate their daughters about family responsibilities. In addition, government authorities and societal stakeholders should act aimed at enhancing child protection measures while reducing the vulnerability of girls towards domestic abuse. Finally, divorced young wives need crucial financial support enabling them to communicate effectively in a society, wherein increasing independence becomes feasible.","Sociology and Political Science, Law","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This study aims to investigate the key determinants influencing FRP adoption among senior citizens in Tangshan City, Hebei, China. A theoretical model is developed by integrating the Belief-Attitude-Intention (B-A-I) framework with the extended Technology-Organization-Environment-Individual (TOE-I) framework. The model explores the effects of convenience, familiarity, social support, and perceived privacy risk on trust and satisfaction, which subsequently shape the intention to use FRP. Moreover, technology anxiety is examined as a moderating factor that may weaken or strengthen the relationship between trust, satisfaction, and intention to use. This framework provides theoretical insights into digital payment adoption behavior and practical guidance for policymakers and service providers aiming to promote inclusive, age-friendly financial technologies in China and other aging societies.","Multidisciplinary","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The study incorporates a financial literacy (FL) perspective in the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model to explore the effect of FL on users’ adoption intentions. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional research design, utilising a sample of 389 urban and 323 rural users familiar with digital health insurance platform. Furthermore, this study employed partial least squares multi-group analysis (PLS-MGA) to examine the path differences between urban and rural groups. Results: The results revealed some differences in the factors that shape the willingness of urban and rural users to adopt digital health insurance platforms. Performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), and FL positively affect the adoption intentions of rural and urban users. However, facilitating conditions only positively affect rural users’ adoption intentions. Regarding the moderation effect, FL strengthens the effect of PE on adoption intentions for both urban and rural users. Interestingly, FL shows differences moderating role between urban and rural users in the relationship between EE and SI on adoption intentions. Implication: By introducing a FL perspective, this study addresses the lack of attention to FL in Insurtech studies. It provides a theoretical basis for the government and platform operators in formulating differentiated promotion strategies to help increase the popularity of health insurance in urban and rural areas.","Health Policy, Health Informatics, Computer Science Applications, Health Information Management","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This urgency has spurred a demand for sustainable practices in various sectors, including hospitality. Within this context, hospitality management is investigating the intricate relationship between sustainability practices and consumer behavior, particularly in luxury hotels. Researchers are exploring how sustainability influences customer purchase intentions, but existing systematic literature reviews (SLRs) often fall short of providing a comprehensive analysis of the dominant perspectives between hospitality management and related fields. Many SLRs inadequately synthesize the theories and methodologies employed in studying consumer behavior toward green hotels, offering insights primarily into specific aspects like eco-certifications and consumer willingness to pay without integrating these findings into a cohesive theoretical framework. Furthermore, existing reviews often overlook the contributions of different disciplines, such as marketing, economics, and environmental science to consumer perceptions of sustainable practices. This paper aims to fill these gaps by identifying published research on luxury green hotels, examining the methodologies and theories utilized, and suggesting future research opportunities. A systematic review following Kitchenham & Charters (2007) guidelines was conducted on literature published from 2018 to 2024, focusing on this emerging field. Results indicate inadequate application of Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) theory in existing research. This paper highlights the contributions of various scholars and concludes with discussions on potential avenues for further research in sustainability and consumer behavior within the luxury hospitality sector.","Multidisciplinary","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Through a descriptive analysis of primary and secondary sources, this study investigates Japan’s trajectory towards potential constitutional amendment and further militarization, with a focus on Article 9—a key provision renouncing the use of force and restricting military capabilities. By tracing historical contexts and the U.S.-Japan security alliance, the paper explores Japan’s post-war pacifism and the gradual evolution of its Self-Defense Forces (SDF) within constitutional constraints. Despite inherent constraints, Japan has developed a robust military force, challenging traditional perceptions of its rearmament. While the nation has incrementally expanded its defense posture, legal and political obstacles remain, necessitating constitutional revisions to align its military strategy with contemporary security challenges. Externally, Japan faces threats such as North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and China’s assertive regional policies, while internally, public sentiment, historical legacies, and legal obstacles shape the discourse on constitutional reform. Japan’s path towards constitutional amendment hinges on regional security dynamics and the strength of the U.S.-Japan alliance. The extent of US commitment to regional stability and its capacity to address Japanese security concerns may significantly determine the pace and direction of Japan’s defense normalization. Although Japan is militarily prepared to address emerging security threats, its constitutional constraints persist as a legal challenge. Findings indicate that through a series of incremental military policies, Japan has effectively rearmed itself with credible self-defense capabilities, despite the continued legal restrictions imposed by its pacifist constitution.","Business and International Management, Political Science and International Relations, Strategy and Management","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The main objective is to investigate patterns in the geometric representation of the Motzkin sequence and analyze these representations to construct the Wing sequence. The Motzkin sequence, which counts the number of ways to draw non-intersecting chords between points on a circle serves as the basis for this study. The geometric representation of these chords, particularly for n = 1, 2, 3and 4, is analyzed to reveal patterns and properties that could be modified to generate a new sequence. Based on the analysis, we tried some iterations for n=3 and n=4 to develop initial ideas for constructing the Wing sequence. The technique involved modifying the geometric representation of the Motzkin sequence to derive the Wing sequence. This process included transforming the non-intersecting chords into a circular representation into a linear arrangement. We then removed any representations without chords and only considered those with chords. Next, we transformed the chords into directed paths. Since these directed paths only connected two points, we combined them to form directed paths that passed through all points at least once. These results identified a pattern between the first and second points, leading to the Fist-Second-Third-Points (FSTP) technique for constructing the Wing sequence. The main findings include deriving a general formula for the Wing sequence, establishing a recurrence relation, and constructing a generating function. These results highlight the applicability of the geometric representation technique in discovering new sequences and enhancing geometric representation techniques in mathematical research. The techniques developed in this study can be applied to other geometric problems, offering researchers a more intuitive understanding of structures. Further exploration of these results may open up various applications for combinatorial structures, such as network routing issues, project scheduling, and key generation involving data security.","Computer Science (all), Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty, Information Systems and Management","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

To address these issues, the government implemented the “one-child policy.” However, by the 1980s, fertility rates had sharply declined, resulting in detrimental effects due to the continued implementation of the policy. In response, the “two-child policy” was introduced in 2015, but fertility rates continued to drop. The “three-child policy” was introduced in 2021 as additional reinforcement. The ongoing decline in fertility has negatively impacted the country’s economy by causing labor shortages, slowing population growth, accelerating improvements in living standards, and speeding up capital accumulation. Therefore, this study aims to empirically examine these assertions in China using data from 1979 to 2021, employing the innovative quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) model introduced by Cho et al., (Journal of Econometrics 188 1 281 300, 2015). The findings revealed that fertility reduction decreases the size of the Chinese population by 0.13% in the long run. Furthermore, it improves the standard of living for the Chinese people by 0.03% in the long run. Moreover, it has reduced the Chinese capital investment rate in both the short and long run by 0.93% and 0.50%, respectively. Finally, it encourages the growth rate of the Chinese economy by 0.38% in the long run. Based on empirical findings, this study will provide insights into population control strategies and guide future government family planning policies in shaping both the population size and economic growth in China.","Economics and Econometrics","Xi'an Jiaotong University","Xi'an","China"

Under quantitative research design, data from 110 EFL learners from Dhaka, Bangladesh, was collected via questionnaire. The data was analysed using IBM SPSS for a correlation study and IBM SPSS AMOS for conducting path and mediation analyses. The results revealed significant positive correlation of autonomous and controlled motivation with all the basic psychological needs factors and attribution except for the need for competence and context attribution. In addition, the path model showed that learners with high autonomy satisfaction had higher effort attribution. Also, the need for competence significantly influenced learners’ ability attribution which, in turn, significantly affected learners’ autonomous and controlled motivation. Furthermore, ability and context attribution mediated the relation between needs satisfaction and learner motivation.

However, small and medium enterprises are hesitant in product innovation, particularly in developing nations or low-income countries due to resource constraints, which retards performance. Therefore, the objective of the study is to analyse the mediating role of product innovation for achieving superior performance of SMEs through entrepreneurial orientation and knowledge management. This study concentrates especially on small- and medium-sized enterprises in Pakistan. The study is based on primary research, and the data has been collected by applying simple random sampling with the aid of adopted questionnaires. The research hypothesis and the framework have been developed with the support of knowledge-based view, resource-based view, and contingency theory. For testing the hypotheses, the researchers used the structural equation modelling technique. The developed hypotheses were confirmed by the findings drawn from a sample of 384 small and medium enterprises. Open innovation has been identified as a significant mediator between entrepreneurial orientation and performance of small and medium enterprises along with knowledge management and performance of small and medium enterprises. The findings have great significance, since they show that product innovation requires knowledge management as alone entrepreneurial orientation is insufficient. By using the resource-based view, knowledge-based view, and contingency theory, the study on product innovation to boost the performance of small and medium enterprises has been conducted while catering the factors that influence product innovation. The study differs from the prior studies because product innovation in developing countries has hardly gained importance; secondly, linking the three theoretical underpinnings in one single framework is the major contribution, as the study shows that to boost performance, the three theories complement each other to boost the performance of small and medium enterprises.","Economics and Econometrics","Tecnológico de Monterrey","Monterrey","Mexico"

Social media marketing activities (SMMAs) have emerged as a key strategy, yet their effectiveness in driving brand-related outcomes remains underexplored. Additionally, the role of customer satisfaction (CST) as a potential mediator in this relationship is not well understood. This study examines the impact of SMMAs on brand loyalty (BL) and brand awareness (BA) while investigating the mediating effect of CST. Guided by the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) theory, this study employs a quantitative research approach, collecting data from a sample of social media users who follow telecom brands in Yemen. Structural equation modeling (SEM) via SmartPLS is used to analyze the collected data. The findings reveal that SMMAs significantly enhance BL and BA, indicating the effectiveness of digital marketing efforts in shaping brand perceptions. Furthermore, CST plays a critical mediating role, reinforcing the link between SMMAs and brand-related outcomes. The findings of this study suggest that consumer engagement on social media platforms is a key driver in translating marketing efforts into improved brand loyalty and awareness.","Business and International Management, Accounting, Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous), Strategy and Management, Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management, Management Science and Operations Research, Marketing","Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University | Thamar University","Nanded | Thamar","India | Yemen"

However, the allure of high repayment rates and low non-performing loans has attracted for-profit investors to the microfinance landscape, seeking not only to extend loan services to the poor but also to generate profits. Consequently, a growing number of for-profit Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) have emerged in developing countries. This study examines the implications of profit orientation on the governance structure, outreach goal, and financial sustainability of MFIs. To accomplish this, we collected data from 1189 unique MFIs in 105 countries spanning 2010 to 2018 and applied both non-parametric (e.g., t-test and Kruskal Wallis) and parametric tests (e.g., regressions analysis). Our findings revealed significant differences in governance structure between for-profit and nonprofit MFIs, with the latter exhibiting larger board sizes and greater gender diversity. We also observed variations in outreach, with nonprofit MFIs demonstrating broader coverage and greater depth. Finally, empirical evidence highlighted differences in financial sustainability, as nonprofit MFIs tend to have higher financial health than their for-profit counterparts. However, the effect of nonprofit status was mostly consistent with the baseline results for middle-income countries but mixed and insignificant for low-income countries (except for governance indicators). These findings have policy implications, underscoring the need for MFIs transitioning from nonprofit to for-profit status to adapt their governance structure, realign their outreach mission, and refocus on financial sustainability accordingly.","Strategy and Management","International University of Business Agriculture and Technology | Universiti Sains Malaysia","Dhaka | Minden","Bangladesh | Malaysia"
