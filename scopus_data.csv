The emphasis on this paper rests on the contributions made by personality and the act of implicit knowledge-sharing to improve individual presentation, with special regards to managers in the public sector. There is a potential that this paper can serve to justify how individual differences are able to weave their way among knowledge workers for performance improvement. The assessment of personality traits is performed using the Big Five Inventory, where the traits are extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience, neuroticism and conscientiousness. Tacit knowledge sharing, on the other hand, is realized through mentoring and knowledge-sharing agenda. This current study is targeted at Malaysian public sector managers who are expected to distribute their valuable knowledge with others and help enhance individual productivity. Individual performance system is introduced as a measuring tool on individual productivity which comprises of four main components; knowledge and expertise, personal quality, leadership and community contribution. It is suggested that for the purpose of practising knowledge sharing, managers need to possess some personality traits to improve their employees' performance.","Arts and Humanities (all), Social Sciences (all), Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Despite this progress, there still exist wide performance gap between human speech recognition (HSR) and ASR which has inhibited its full adoption in real life situation. A brief review of research progress on Yorùbá Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is presented in this paper focusing of variability as factor contributing to performance gap between HSR and ASR with a view of x-raying the advances recorded, major obstacles, and chart a way forward for development of ASR for Yorùbá that is comparable to those of other tone languages and of developed nations. This is done through extensive surveys of literatures on ASR with focus on Yorùbá. Though appreciable progress has been recorded in advancement of ASR in the developed world, reverse is the case for most of the developing nations especially those of Africa. Yorùbá like most of languages in Africa lacks both human and materials resources needed for the development of functional ASR system much less taking advantage of its potentials benefits.

To address this gap, this paper reviews software frameworks in general and conducts a systematic review of 20 designed frameworks in the biomedical informatics domain. Consequently, this paper provides three results. First, it identifies a number of categories to be used to gain an intensive and extensive understanding of the designed MPMF. Second, it identifies a set of success factors, called Factors of Successful Application Frameworks (FSAF), to be used to enhance the design of MPMF. Third, it presents a research agenda that shows lacks and gaps in the designed MPMF and provides a foundation to help researchers design enhanced MPMF. The results show that, as of yet, there is no study integrating all the FSAF to enhance the design of MPMF.

A number of researchers have tied to make sense of the term. Moreover, the importance of career success has been highlighted during the 2007-2012 financial crises that had a massage for career pursuers. The crisis is known by economists as the worst since the great depression of the 1930's. Some of best institutions collapsed and stocks markets began to crash, resulting in bailout by the governments. In the wake of global economic turmoil, there is unemployment rampant which has made people to re-think about their careers and what it holds for them. It is, therefore, important to look into career success especially with regards to the various factors causing it. The present article has an emphasis on gender, human resource management policies and cross cultural comparisons from previous research done so as to get a better picture of the dependent variable, i.e. career success. These factors have been chosen as they are a representative of an individual, an organization and a nation respectively.

In Malaysia, the safeguard of this fundamental right is provided under Article 11(1) of the Federal Constitution with some limitations. The right to convert out of one' s faith is not mentioned explicitly. However, for the non- Muslims, this right to opt out of one' s faith and choose another has been regarded as an implicit part of religious liberty guaranteed by Article 11. In relation to the Muslims, the issue of apostasy is regarded as a taboo as well as a politically explosive proposition. This paper aims to examine the concept of freedom of religion under international law focusing mainly on the issue of apostasy in the context of the Malaysian Federal Constitution.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs price model to examine the influence of FD level and time on the value relevance of three accounting variables relative to three share price proxies for 91 Jordanian companies (consisting of 5,460 observations) within 2004-2009. Findings: Relative to three share price proxies, the findings proved that FD level and time have a significant influence on the value relevance of book value, but not for cash flows. Also, FD level and time have a significant influence on the value relevance of earnings relative to annual closing share price, while they are not relative to share price after a three-month period following the financial year-end. FD time has a significant influence on the value relevance of earnings relative to the average annual share price. Annual closing share price is the most reliable in indicating value relevance of accounting information. Originality/value: The paper confirms that there is a shift away from earnings towards book value as the basis for firm valuation.

In many cases human factors were attributed as the cause of the problem. Humans are well known as the weakest link in the security chain. Commonly, end-users will depend on security messages when confronted with security-related decision making. Most of the time, end-users will try their best to make sense of unclear instructions in order to cope with situations. This indicates the way security messages are presented is of utmost importance. However, research focusing on designing effective security messages is quite limited. This paper presents research in progress, towards designing effective security messages focusing on passwords guidelines. Our initial review indicated the lack of persuasive elements in the current password guidelines may lead to unmotivated behaviour of producing good (strong) passwords. This paper also includes initial results obtained from pilot study which reveal promising results supporting the usage of persuasion strategies to improve the current state information security compliance. © 2013 IEEE.","Computer Networks and Communications, Human-Computer Interaction, Information Systems","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The presences of a serial autocorrelation results in a number of problems, including an increase in the type I error rate and thereby increase the expected number of false alarm in the process observation. However, the independency assumption is often violated in practice due to the influence of serial correlation in the observation. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to demonstrate with the hospital admission data, the influence of serial correlation on the statistical control charts. The trend free pre-whitening (TFPW) method has been used and applied as an alternative method to obtain residuals series which are statistically uncorrelated to each other. In this study, a data set of daily hospital admission for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases was used from the period of 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009 (365 days). Result showed that TFPW method is an easy and useful method in removing the influence of serial correlation from the hospital admission data. It can be concluded that statistical control chart based on residual series perform better compared to original hospital admission series which influenced by the effects of serial correlation data. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.","Physics and Astronomy (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

There are two objectives that must be considered in order to achieve knowledge management processes; it is getting the right knowledge to people, thus enabling them in engaging with it and learning from it. However, it must go through the process of socialization as these involve social interactions to accomplish knowledge sharing activities. This social interaction consists of individual interactions and participation occurs when both important elements are involved, the knowledge sharing becomes effective. Knowledge sharing has been the most discussed topic and a challenge for organizations because of its importance in the success of knowledge management efforts. In general, knowledge sharing is related to an action which refers to people's behavior or actions in sharing or not sharing knowledge, donating and collecting knowledge. In this paper, the discussion about knowledge sharing relates to peoples' behavior, and this behavior must be assisted and therefore it leads to the term knowledge sharing behavior. Many researchers believed that weblogs are an innovative knowledge sharing technology. The increase use of weblogs each year has shown that weblogs are an effective social networking medium and can be extended beyond simple communication within a community. Many research studies in Malaysia are focused on knowledge sharing behavior within the organization and community. A few studies were conducted to explore knowledge sharing behavior among webloggers. However, research study that focuses on profit oriented webloggers still has not been explored in Malaysia. Thus, this paper discusses our present research that intends to explore the role of individual factor in knowledge sharing behavior among profit oriented webloggers. The paper will highlight the problems related to knowledge sharing behavior from the perspective of profit oriented webloggers and how these problems can be addressed. In addressing these problems, a few interviews will be conducted with identified webloggers. This study will adapt knowledge sharing behavior theories such as Theory of Planned Behavior, Social Cognitive Theory, Social Capital Theory and Social Exchange Theory. This will help us to understand the individual factors that can influence knowledge sharing behavior among profit oriented webloggers in Malaysia.","Information Systems and Management, Management Science and Operations Research","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Research on public sector performance management systems, however, points to problems in the design and management of these systems and questions their effectiveness as policy tools for increasing governmental performance. It has been reported that the problem involves the lack of integration between performance management at the strategic, operational and individual levels. In the tax administration context, the integration issue in performance management has also been highlighted. However, the existing literature does not propose how to overcome this issue. This paper introduces an innovative way to undertake tax administration performance management based on an integrated and open systems model. The distinct feature of the model is that it highlights the critical process of transforming inputs into outputs/outcomes in a tax administration by diagnosing the interrelation of the components in the process, i.e. formal organisation, informal organisation, task and people. These components contain both institutional and behavioural factors which have significant effect on tax administration performance. A set of guidelines is also developed in this paper to enable application of the performance management model. A case study was undertaken to test the applicability of the model to tax administration based on the guidelines developed. The case study shows that the model enable better management of tax administration performance by providing valuable feedback on the present state of a tax administration, identifying possible reasons for underperformance and highlighting ways in which a tax administration can improve its performance.","Public Administration","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

However, in Yemen, where majority of people refuse to use bank services in facilitating their financial needs, this issue is still ongoing. In fact, it is one of the top issues that concern the Yemeni economy. As a result, the present research attempts to minimize the gap between studies by examining the factors that influence Yemeni consumers' use of banking services. These consumers are distinct from those in the developed countries, with regards to their psychological, cultural and behavioral use of banking system. Data collection was conducted through questionnaires distributed to university students and analyzed through SPSS 17. In addition, the proposed hypotheses were tested statistically through factor analysis, correlation analysis and regression analysis. The results highlighted the relationship between service quality, banking legal framework, bank advertisement, which significantly and positively affected behavioral intention with the exception of cultural belief.

In addition, the data involves a substantial amount of noise and false positive results that hinder the downstream analysis performance. To address these problems Bayesian network model has attracted the most attention. However, the key challenge in using Bayesian network to model GRN is related to its learning structure. Bayesian network structure learning is NP-hard and computationally complex. Therefore, this research aims to address the issue related to Bayesian network structure learning by proposing a low-order conditional independence method. In addition we revised the gene regulatory relationships by integrating biological heterogeneous dataset to extract transcription factors for regulator and target genes.

But in an emerging nation like Nigeria, where structures and enforcement mechanisms have been reported weak, there is the need to examine factors responsible. This paper takes steps towards developing a stakeholder perspective to examine any relationship between enforcement structures and board performance for effective corporate functioning. Methodology: Based on survey perceptions of 154 respondents from the Nigerian regulatory enforcement agencies and sampled public firms, the study employs confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach; a model that relates three enforcement structure variables to board performance is proposed. Findings: Building upon enforcement structure construct based on stakeholder framework, the study found the dimensions of regulatory capacity, monitoring compliance, and enforcement mechanisms as the valid measures. The study concludes that enforcement has significant effect on board performance. However, regulatory capacity indicators correlate as valid measures. Hence, confirmed through CFA and the structural model (SEM). Originality: The paper explores new research idea on board and focus on strenghtening regulatory framework by Nigerian enforcement agencies. This adds to knowledge, enhances regulatory capacity and reduce conflicts of interests.

In this chapter, the authors present the concept of conspicuous consumption and explore the spread of luxury culture, especially in the Asian countries, since previous studies have tested such phenomena predominantly in Western countries. The spread of the luxury model as suggested by Chadha and Husband (2006) helps to better understand the spread of luxury culture among Asian societies. In the past, many studies have suggested that conspicuous and luxury concepts are related to each other. By examining the conspicuous motivation among consumers, the authors hope to explain why people are motivated to engage with luxury consumption from a cultural theoretical lens, particularly in Asian countries. Finally, they highlight the managerial and theoretical implications, followed by research directions for future transcultural marketing studies.","Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all), Business, Management and Accounting (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

It is well established that dyslexics, due to dyslexia, have difficulties to learn, especially when it comes to reading that is caused by visual and auditory deficits. Unfortunately, reading applications, mostly in English language, are not designed specifically for dyslexics in terms of its form, content, and behaviour for such application. Hence, to help them read better, an IxD guidelines tailored specifically for dyslexic children is proposed. These guidelines are translated into prototype and show how the intended, suitable form, content, and behaviour would be.

As such, this paper proposes an alternative approach in learning Mathematics, i.e. by utilising the shadow play (Wayang Kulit - WK) technique. This approach is the state of art and practice in terms of learning paradigm. We address the challenges that hamper the success of the Wayang Kulit technique for Deep-Learning (DeL) in Mathematics. Subsequently, we formulate strategies for modeling a Digital Wayang Kulit (DWK) application given a persona name of e-WayCOOL, in order to overcome challenges in L&T, specifically in DeL. The DWK model aims at helping primary school students learn Mathematics in a more engaging way by using the Rapid Application Development. Seven aspects of WK are combined to represent situation, behaviour, numbers, and mathematical operations which enable learning activities to take place. Control mechanism is also provided in the DWK model so that students can maneuver the characters in DWK.","Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

An agribusiness portal in Malaysia is chosen for this study, in which a variety of agro-based products are marketed. Constructs were employed from literature review and existing research models. Hypotheses were crafted and their effects were then measured using statistical techniques. Based on the empirical result obtained, it has been discovered that product description together with product information signals such as value, facilitation of buying process, communication, third party product certification and seller description have different influencing power to reduce product uncertainty in agro-based product. Specifically, third party product certification and facilitation of buying process have the least influence power in this context of study. Suggestions are also provided towards improving the portal in reducing product uncertainty. By incorporating elements suggested in online product description, sellers' integrity will be raised, thus increasing trust for purchasing agro-based products online.","Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Although manual labeling and segmentation are always the best, automated approach is potentially promising as alternative approach for a more efficient process. In an attempt to automatically label and segment dyslexic children's read speech, this paper investigates whether or not the automated approach can be as accurate as compared with the manual one. This is due to the highly phonetically similar reading errors produced when they read that have affected automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this work, experiments were performed using a specifically designed ASR to force-align the read speech and produce the labels and segmentations automatically. The CSLU toolkit's force alignment algorithm has been employed to measure their performances. Selected speech data of dyslexic children's reading in Malay were fed to the algorithm as input and the evaluation resulted in 95% agreement on phonetic labeling and only 65% on segmentation with respect to the manual ones.","Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This is because, in large measure, it is a condition which is a precursor for a range of more serious diseases, including diabetes and hypertension. Interest in a particular condition often results in governments and public health bodies setting targets aimed at reducing the prevalence of that condition in the general population. However, it appears that public health targets are not set by any informed background analysis but rather by what seems reasonable and is tolerable in political terms. In the UK in 2008 the then government announced that it would be striving, by 2020, to bring the obesity metrics back to those prevailing in 2000. Based upon a population-level model addressing the development of overweight and obesity in children (2-15 years), we demonstrate that the achievement of this target (in children) is highly unlikely. The model, which combines knowledge from nutrition, physical activity and body metabolism, shows that a plausible target date would be 2026 at least. Acknowledgement of the delays involved in reversing obesity trends is vital in setting sensible targets in this domain of public health. In general, models have an important role to play in the formulation of achievable public health targets.","Management of Technology and Innovation, Strategy and Management, Computational Theory and Mathematics, Management Science and Operations Research, Modeling and Simulation, Numerical Analysis","Salford Business School","Manchester","United Kingdom"

The application is a result of years of study on dyslexic children and their colour choices. Bedside experiment with the children was carried out on a systematic background and a foreground colour scheme, specifically on syllables, words, and short sentences.

Supplier quality performance evaluation reflects the actual performance of the supplier exhibited at customer's end. It is critical in enabling the organization to determine the area of improvement and thereafter works with supplier to close the gaps. Success of the customer partly depends on supplier's quality performance. Key criteria as quality, cost, delivery, technology support and customer service are categorized as main factors in contributing to supplier's quality performance. 18 suppliers' who were manufacturing automotive application parts evaluated in year 2010 using weight point system. There were few suppliers with common rating which led to common ranking observed by few suppliers'. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a user friendly decision making tool for complex and multi criteria problems was used to evaluate the supplier's quality performance challenging the weight point system that was used for 18 suppliers'. The consistency ratio was checked for criteria and sub-criteria. Final results of AHP obtained with no overlap ratings, therefore yielded a better decision making methodology as compared to weight point rating system. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.","Physics and Astronomy (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The first algorithm aims to solve SVM model selection problem. ACO originally deals with discrete optimization problem. In applying ACO for solving SVM model selection problem which are continuous variables, there is a need to discretize the continuously value into discrete values. This discretization process would result in loss of some information and hence affects the classification accuracy and seeking time. In this algorithm we propose to solve SVM model selection problem using IACOR without the need to discretize continuous value for SVM. The second algorithm aims to simultaneously solve SVM model selection problem and selects a small number of features. SVM model selection and selection of suitable and small number of feature subsets must occur simultaneously because error produced from the feature subset selection phase will affect the values of SVM model selection and result in low classification accuracy. In this second algorithm we propose the use of IACOMV to simultaneously solve SVM model selection problem and features subset selection. Ten benchmark datasets were used to evaluate the proposed algorithms.

Consequently museums around the world utilize such information and communications technology (ICT) tools in order to provide richer learning experiences for their visitors. This paper discusses a study that investigated the relationship between multimedia instructional formats with individual cognitive learning preferences in a museum learning environment. A total of 91 school children age between 10 to 12 years old were randomly assigned into treatment groups based on their cognitive learning ratio. We employed a pre-test post-test quasi experimental design to reveal that general performance of the children exposed to the physical museum exhibits is better than the online museum environment. Although single cognitive learning preferences were evaluated, our findings suggest that analytics perform better than the wholists when exposed to the physical exhibits; whilst the result is reversed for the online exhibits environment. Verbalisers were found to be better than visualisers in the physical a museum context. Yet they were found to have slight differences when compared to visualisers in an online environment. Our findings on the combined cognitive styles (CCS) show that the analytics-visualisers' mean scores were different between physical and online exhibits, compared to the other three CCS.","Health Informatics, Respiratory Care","RMIT University | Universiti Utara Malaysia","Melbourne | Sintok","Australia | Malaysia"

Design/methodology/approach - This survey-based study was a cross-sectional study. The samples were drawn by using stratified random sampling procedure from large Indonesian manufacturing companies based on the directory provided by the Data and Information Center of Indonesian Ministry of Industry with the final number of respondents of 139. Four main hypotheses were developed and tested statistically by applying multivariate data analyses. Findings - The results provided evidence that lean practices should be implemented holistically. Lean practices have a positive and significant impact on both OP and BP. Moreover, OP partially mediates the relationship between lean practices and BP. Research limitations/implications - The data used in this survey represent self-reporting by mainly the middle or top management in production. Practical implications - This study contributes to the lean manufacturing (LM) body of knowledge by identifying the relationships between the LM practices, OP, and BP. Understanding these relationships will help practitioners in making better decisions in manufacturing organizations as well as enable application of the concepts in this study to other contexts such as service organizations. Originality/value - Although there are a growing number of anecdotal and empirical evidences in favor of LM in manufacturing environment, there has been almost no theory-building and methodologically rigorous research examining the link between LM, OP, and BP.

Scholars from the Judeo-Christian background and to a large extent, modern Western societies have contributed immensely to this field of thought. However, the fact that many other religions, societies and ethnic groups throughout the world have achieved economic prosperities and tremendous advancements in their history shows that their contribution to this issue could also be meaningful if properly harnessed. The Islamic view of work ethics which has either been misunderstood or not widely studied in the field of organizational studies falls in this category and thus, there is a need to bring it into light in the cotemporary where Islam is now becoming a force to reckon with in many societies. Thus bearing the above in mind, this study is an analogical deduction of work ethics from the pages of the Quran. Using the method of textual analyzes, it deduced what the Quran has to say about the concept of work ethics for the Muslim and mankind at large. To fulfill its aim, the study examines some concepts through which the Quran talks about work and highlight the ethics that could be deduced from this. It starts by scanning the passages of the Quran in order to understand how it sees work and its relationship with ethics; the concept of time and how important this is as it concerns work how work is related to the concept of wealth and gaining wealth. Finally, it concludes on the note that if properly studied, the Quran is a rich fountain for ethics which are related to work and which if properly harnessed, could help the Muslims and mankind in general in overcoming the issues of corruption, exploitation and other vices which are inimical to the economic well being of the human societies. © Medwell Journals, 2013.","Social Sciences (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

While multinational corporations (MNCs) must consider the advantages and disadvantages of hiring local employees for specific roles, expatriates' roles are still significant. Culturally adjusting to the local environment has always been a problem for most expatriates and their accompanying family members. Failing to adjust culturally will lead to mediocre performance and under-utilising the wealth of host country-related information that only locals possess. Therefore, this research highlights the influential role that accompanying expatriate spouses could play in ensuring the smooth communication and cooperation between expatriates and their local subordinates and the local community. Path analyses of 134 expatriate and spouse related matched datasets show that spouses are more positively accepted by the host country nationals (HCNs) as opposed to expatriates. New relationships emerged from the path analyses which indicated the influential roles that spouses play in establishing better rapport with the locals. As such it is suggested that spouses are the 'missing link' that could foster better social integration and cross cultural communication and adjustment between expatriates and the host country nationals.

EEG signals capture important information pertinent to different physiological brain states. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for evaluating the power-accuracy trade-off for EEG-based compressive sensing and classification techniques in the context of epileptic seizure detection in wireless tele-monitoring. The framework incorporates compressive sensing-based energy-efficient compression, and noisy wireless communication channel to study the effect on the application accuracy. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) and compressive sensing are used for EEG signals acquisition and compression. To obtain low-complexity energy-efficient, the best data accuracy with higher compression ratio is sought. A reconstructed algorithm derived from DCT of daubechie's wavelet 6 is used to decompose the EEG signal at different levels. DCT is combined with the best basis function neural networks for EEG signals classification. Extensive experimental work is conducted, utilizing four classification models. The obtained results show an improvement in classification accuracies and an optimal classification rate of about 95% is achieved when using NN classifier at 85% of CR in the case of no SNR value. The satisfying results demonstrate the effect of efficient compression on maximizing the sensor lifetime without affecting the application's accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.","Computer Networks and Communications","Computer Science and Engineering Department, College of Engineering, Qatar University | Universiti Utara Malaysia","Doha | Sintok","Qatar | Malaysia"

Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected from 201 expatriates working in Malaysia and analyse by using structural equation modelling (Amos-16). Findings: The results of the study indicated that expatriate adjustment (work, general and interaction) mediate the relationship between individual and organizational factors and expatriate performance (supervisor rated). Research limitations/implications: The data were collected from the expatriates working in Malaysian universities. There can be differences between education industry and pure business organization in terms of working environment, selection process and management support. The respondents were citizens of different countries around the world which include Asia, Europe and Middle East. Even though Malaysia is a multicultural society and expatriates from any part of the world can find themselves in Malaysia, this research did not group the respondents in terms of their cultural differences and similarities with Malaysian culture. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that human resource managers and MNC's management should provide direct and indirect support to the expatriates and their families in terms of language and cultural training, career development, logistical assistance, family mentoring, psychological counselling, job search, self-development and social activities. Furthermore, recruitment managers and MNC's management should consider these factors before appointing any employee for international assignment. Finally, the findings of this research suggest that better expatriate performance help MNC's to perform better in their international operations which will ultimately improve the home and host country economic situation. The better performance of MNC's in their international operations through effective expatriate performance will encourage other domestic organizations to expand their operations globally. Originality/value: Expatriate literature have highlighted many individual and organizational factors which affect expatriate job performance and adjustment but the role of some individual and organizational factors is still not clear and/or ignored by past researchers. For example, the role of direct and indirect support has not been well conceptualized in past studies. In addition, only a few studies have explained the importance of self-efficacy, cultural sensitivity and social network in expatriate literature.

The bank operational process which is intended to meet emerging challenges of bank consolidation, operating cost containment, improvement of customer service and increase revenue call for innovative banking practices through Business Process Re-engineering. This is to enable Nigerian banks to incorporate strategic innovative customer schemes in order to bridge the service gap inherent in a Nigerian banking sector. The broad objectives of this study are: 1) to determine the current status of an operational process reengineered in the Nigerian banks; and 2) To determine the most organizational objective of BPR implementation in Nigerian banks. Self- delivery and collection of data strategy with help of research assistants were used to in this study. Out of 560 questionnaires distributed to the sampled banks, 417 were returned representing 74% rate. First, the study found that Nigerian banks surveyed have re-engineered their branch operations, customer services, cash tellering services, cheque's clearing, domestic fund transfer, loan processing, credit administration and appraisal. In addition, 21.3% of the banks surveyed have reengineered their services with respect to foreign operations, process for letter of credit, Western Union/MoneyGram money payment and wire transfer to a fund through SWIFT and other electronic channels. Second, the result showed that 24.7% of the surveyed banks agreed that enhancement of profit is the most objective of BPR implementation. These followed closely by 23.3% of the surveyed banks that are of the opinion that improvement over the quality of customer service is the most objective of BPR adoption. Furthermore, 20.4%, 11.5% and 12.9% of the survey banks are of the opinion that organisation objective of BPR adoption was to either be proactive, reactive for future/current challenges, competitive pressure being faced as a result of globalization and deregulation of the financial sector or to reduce operating cost respectively. The outcome from this study provides important insights to both managers and researchers for further understanding about the objectives of BPR adoption, and the operational processes reengineered by the banks.

In order to enhance SVM performance and solving the discretization problem, this study proposes two algorithms to optimize SVM parameters using Continuous ACO (ACOR) and Incremental Continuous Ant Colony Optimization (IACOR) without the need to discretize continuous value for SVM parameters. Eight datasets from UCI were used to evaluate the credibility of the proposed integrated algorithm in terms of classification accuracy and size of features subset.

This paper presents a dynamic beaconing update mechanism (DBUM). In the DBUM, the mobile nodes dynamically adjust their beacon intervals based on prespecified tolerance deviation distance by using the dynamic fuzzy logic controller. Moreover, with DBUM, a node applies the residual link lifetime with its neighboring node to refresh their entries in its NLM. Compared with the existing algorithms, evaluation results reveal that the proposed DBUM algorithm increases the accuracy of a node's information in its NLM matrix and achieves high packet delivery ratio at the expense of negligible overhead increment.","Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Science Applications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The criterion for selecting useful components based on unity eigenvalue works well for small and moderate sizes of variables, but troublesome for large number of variables. Results of simulations give evidence that the proposed strategy shows good performance with small value of error rate in classifying future objects through new extracted components for the investigated population.

Disability could be caused by various types of impairment. There were two barriers such as social barriers and material barriers contribute to eliminate disabled employees from the labor market and also make separation between disabled employees and other employees. Data for this study were obtained from existing literatures on disabled employment and the hospitality industry. The methodology heavily relied on existing previous literatures on the subject being dealt with. The positive environment would be made in the workplace once people with disabilities are satisfying the employers with their work efficiency. Practicing corporate social responsibility (CSR) by the employer would contribute to decrease social barriers for disabled employees in the industry. The law of not discriminating to disabled employees ought to be implemented in workplace to utilize their skills properly. Contributing in the labor force could increase the self-determination in order to contribute to the society.

Knowing that understanding the economic progress and the health of the nation generally comes hand in hand, the Saudi Government has showered the health care system with serious considerable attention such as increasing the health care budget. To meet the objective, the present study was conducted among nurses of public hospitals in Saudi Arabia. The reason for the examination of the nurses' performance working specifically in Saudi Arabia lies in the fact that nurses comprise the largest human resource element in healthcare organizations, and thus they have a huge impact on the quality of care and patient outcomes. Despite the efforts being carried out by the Saudi government in developing and enhancing the health sector, there are performance issues particularly with respect to efficient and effective services that are still plaguing the nursing sector specifically and the healthcare industry generally. There is particularly a growing concern about the poor performance of nursing services in Saudi Arabia's public health sector. In terms of theory, the study contributes to the body of knowledge through the examination of the determinants of hospital nurses' performance based on an individual's perspective, and the influence of both the mediation of job stress, and the moderation effect of organizational support in mitigating job stress.","Environmental Science (all), Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

We argue that by adopting a people-based organization, ASEAN now enters an era of Neo-Communitarianism replacing the Old Communitarianism of the old generation of ASEAN. By using communitarian perspectives, we look at the continuities and changes in ASEAN with regard to how it deals with issues involving their members. Three important issues namely the debates on intervention principle; the adoption of the three pillars of the ASEAN Community; and the inclusion of human rights are seen as the signposts where ASEAN departs from their Old to a Neo-Communitarianism. Although there have been a lot of challenges to the realization of the people-based organization, we see that the dynamics of debates and the active participation of the community in the debates show good prospects for the new paradigm to realize. In this paper, we use debate on the formation of ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (ICHR), to show the involvements of people in setting the agendas for the future ASEAN. © 2013 Cambridge University Press.","Sociology and Political Science, Political Science and International Relations","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This paper reports an on-line survey of the attachment styles of registered family therapists in the UK which investigated associations between therapist's attachment style, prior profession, gender and preference for a model of therapy. All 443 UK registered family therapists were surveyed and 82 (19 percent) replied. The survey included two standardised self-report measures: the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) (Bartholomew and Horowitz in Pers Soc Psychol 61:226-244, 1991) and the Experiences in Close Relationships Questionnaire (ECR) (Brennan et al. in Attachment theory and close relationship. The Guilford Press, New York, 1998). The RQ invites respondents to rate the extent to which descriptions of secure, preoccupied, dismissing and fearful attachment styles applied to themselves. The ECR is a more conventional measure similar to a personality inventory. Responses to the two measures were discrepant. On the RQ 61 self-reported as having a 'secure' attachment style, nine 'preoccupied', six 'dismissing' and six were 'fearful'. Responses to the ECR indicated that 24 were 'secure', 16 'preoccupied', 15 'dismissing' and 27 'fearful'. Attachment style, as measured by the ECR, was not associated with therapists' prior profession, gender and preference for a model of therapy. The discrepancy between measures may be attributable to the more transparent RQ measure. Participants' responses may have been based on how they wanted others to view them or how they viewed themselves. These responses are challenged by the findings from the ECR which revealed apparently less desirable adult attachment styles in this sample. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Social Psychology, Cultural Studies, Clinical Psychology, Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

It has been argued that the Southeast Asian regionalism and community building initiatives need to have general public's support and understanding as it had been shown during the early stages of the European integration process. For decades, Southeast Asian regionalism tends to be governed by state. Hence, the study analyses and compares several interlinked variables such as awareness, attitudes, perception and aspiration on the proposed ASEAN Political Security Community (APSC). It is based on a survey conducted in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The questionnaire for the survey combined close-ended and open-ended questions. The questionnaire was made available in three different languages (Bahasa Indonesia, Bahasa Melayu and English). A total number of 1,256 respondents were involved in the study. The quota-sampling procedure was employed to ensure that the respondents were balanced by gender and working status. The study found that respondents in the three countries did show lack of awareness on APSC. They perceived APSC as an elitist and dominated by state agenda. However, the majority of respondents were positive on the future of APSC since they believe that it would contribute among others constructive peaceful resolution in the region. Generally, the study found that respondents displayed some positive attitudes and support for the regional political-security community process, but their aspirations appeared to be different from that of the European regionalism. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Multidisciplinary","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This situation indicates that there is still lack of mechanism for monitoring and ensuring the quality status of the software products and third party assessment and certification are one option to solve this uncertainty. A new model for software certification named as Software Process Assessment and Certification (SPAC) was developed that emphasizes on five main factors: the quality of process, the quality of people, the use of development technology, the quality of working environment and project constraints. The factors were identified through the state of theory and practices. The practicality of the SPAC model was validated through collaboration with industries in Malaysia via case study.

In law, originality has become an important legal doctrine where creativity and innovation have been protected as copyrightable works. Some countries grant copyright protection based on how much labour and diligence it took to create a work, rather than how original a work is. This is referred to as the 'sweat of the brow' doctrine. This doctrine has been recognized at various time in many countries such as USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and elsewhere. In India, the copyright statute has been in existence since long and moreover India is a member of various international intellectual property treaties and conventions, but the situation continues to be pathetic. The lack of protection allows high-profile music directors and domestic musicians in India to get away with copyright infringement.

In theory, TCP should not care whether it is running over wired networks, WLANs, or Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). In practice, it does matter because most TCP deployments have been carefully designed based on the assumption that congestion is the main factor of network instability. However, MANETs have other dominating factors that cause network instability. Forgetting the impact of these factors violates some design principles of TCP congestion control and open questions for future research to address. This study aims to introduce a model that shows the impact of MANET factors on TCP congestion control. To achieve this aim, Design Research Methodology (DRM) proposed by BLESSING was used as a guide to present this model. The proposed model describes the existing situation of TCP congestion control. Furthermore, it points to the factors that are most suitable to be addressed by researchers in order to improve TCP performance. This research proposes a novel model to present the impact of MANET factors on TCP congestion control. The model is expected to serve as a benchmark for any intended improvement and enhancement of TCP congestion control over MANET. © 2013 Science Publications.","Software, Computer Networks and Communications, Artificial Intelligence","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

In the moderated mediation analysis, this research hypothesized, two leadership traits of imams (i.e. motivation to lead or MTL and past leadership experiences) might mediate the influence of three leadership traits (general cognitive ability, personality, and religiosity) toward the imams' managerial leadership behavior. The analysis also hypothesized that the mediation process might be moderated by the imams' high and low job autonomous situation. A structured, Malay version-self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 357 imams around Peninsular Malaysia. Results of the hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the traits of imams explained 40.5% variance of leadership behavior. Specifically, the analysis demonstrated leadership behavior was influenced significantly by the imams' extraversion, agreeableness, and openness personality, social-normative MTL, and past leadership experiences. Imams' religiosity and general cognitive ability did not show potential to influence their leadership behavior. Furthermore, this research found social-normative MTL showed partial mediation on the association of personality extraversion and openness with the criterion.

The system's conventional design is generated from client/server based architecture. This architecture is the main platform for designing the online system architecture, which works based on the distributing concept which is ""tier"". The tier is required to separate the works/tasks between the system architecture. Currently, three-tiers architecture is the most well-known architecture used in GIS applications and other application. However, this architecture has a drawback on the middle tier which needs more processing power to meet the request from multiple of users. GIS applications, especially which involve 3D visualization generate a massive amount of data. Due to this situation, the use of the current three-tier framework for online application of 3D visualization for GIS will decrease the performance of the system in terms of time for processing the request from the users. The aim of this study is to introduce the new four-tier framework and compare it with the existing three-tier framework. This framework consist of four-tier architecture, which is divided into client tier, logic tier, visualization process tier, and database tier. The comparison is based on response time, loading time, frames rate per second, CPU usage, and memory usage. The new framework shows superiority in its performance, and the processing power is reduced.","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)","Universiti Putra Malaysia | Universiti Utara Malaysia","Serdang | Sintok","Malaysia | Malaysia"

The purpose of this paper is to develop a comprehensive framework in order to better understand the role of individual factors in expatriate adjustment and job performance. Design/methodology/approach: The review of past research is used to develop a conceptual framework. Findings: This conceptual paper provides theoretical ground for individual factors which include Big Five, self-efficacy, previous international experience, cultural sensitivity and social network and proposes that expatriate adjustment (work, general and interaction adjustment) mediates the relationship between individual factors (personality traits (Big Five), self-efficacy, previous international experience, cultural sensitivity and social network) and expatriate job performance (rated by peer and supervisor). Practical implications: This paper also provides practical implications for the managers and professionals involved in expatriates' selection, training and performance management. This paper suggests that managers involved in selection of candidates for international assignment should consider personality traits, level of self-efficacy, previous international experience, social network and cultural sensitivity at the time of selection of candidates for international assignment. Furthermore, managers should design pre-departure training programs in a way that enhances candidates' self-efficacy level, overcomes cultural sensitivity, and motivates them to expand social network. Finally, managers should explain to the candidates how they can use their personal skills and knowledge to gain work, general and interactions adjustment in order to achieve job tasks. Originality/value: The proposed framework is developed based on the past theoretical review in order to cover the gap and contribute to the body of knowledge in expatriate literature. Based on the proposed framework, this paper invites researchers to empirically test the suggested propositions in order to further strengthen and develop understanding about individual factors including Big Five and other expatriates' adjustment and job performance predictors. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This is a fieldwork observation research using a survey method (questionnaire) conducted on a population of food handlers who attended a course organised by SLPM. The overall population consists of approximately 8000 food operators who were undergoing trainings for food handlers throughout the state of Kedah. The number of respondent who answered the questionnaires at the pre-programme and post-programme was 400 food handlers who were at that time undergoing food handlers' trainings at schools appointed by LPM specially chosen as the sample of this study. The researchers focused only on the setting of the study which are all the way through the entire state of Kedah looking at the districts of Kulim, Kuala Muda, Kota Setar, Alor Setar and Langkawi. The analysis on the level of understanding about health among food handlers revealed that overall, food handlers responded that they really understand the importance of health in order to administer their business. The result about the overall understanding about health, indicating that before underwent the training, the level of understanding about overall health among the food providers was already high, indicating that they understand that health. Overall, the understanding of the importance of health in the running of business premises indicates a high level. In comparing the understanding level of pre-programme and post-programme, the study reveals that food handlers have already understood the importance of keeping their food, self and premises hygienic while running their business even before they underwent the course module, and their level of understanding increased after attending the course. However, the ministry should always stay alert and sensitive so as this would continue. Leaving this issue unattended will only cause a loss to the food handlers' business because the understanding of food, personal and premise hygiene is very much vital because it is the pull factor that attract customers to go to their premises of which in the end will prosper their business.","Arts and Humanities (all), Social Sciences (all), Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

It looks into students' engagement and their behavioral patterns in two types of guided learning systems (i.e. a fully- and a partially-guided). The research also aims to demonstrate how the engagement evolves from the beginning towards the end of the interactions; which enables analysis to be performed on the quality of engagement. Design/methodology/approach — An experimental study was conducted on 41 students from a public university in Malaysia using two web-based systems as the main learning tools. The students' engagement data were captured three times during the interactions and once at the end of the experimental study using student self-report. Findings — The main outcome of this study suggests that student engagement was changing over time either in positive or negative patterns. The directions of change in both types of guided learning were mainly influenced by the students' background of knowledge. Practical implications — This study demonstrates that student engagement is dynamic. Therefore, progressive assessment is a practical approach to obtain the engagement data which can be used to regulate and improve student engagement in web-based systems.

However this test is very sensitive to nonnormality as well as variance heterogeneity. To overcome the problem of nonnormality, robust method such as Ft test statistic can be used but the test statistic can only perform well when the assumption of homoscedasticity is met. This is due to the biasness of mean as a central tendency measure. This study proposed a robust procedure known as modified Ft method which combines the Ft statistics with one of the popular robust scale estimators, MADn, Tn and LMSn. A simulation study was conducted to compare the robustness (Type I error) of the method with respect to its counterpart from the parametric and non parametric aspects, ANOVA and KruskalWallis respectively.

However, this chart is sensitive in the presence of outliers. To alleviate the problem, this paper proposed alternative Hotelling's T2 charts for individual observations using robust location and scale matrix instead of the usual mean vector and the covariance matrix, respectively. The usual mean vector in the Hotelling T2 chart is replaced by the winsorized modified one-step M-estimator (MOM) whereas the usual covariance matrix is replaced by the winsorized covariance matrix. MOM empirically trims the data based on the shape of the data distribution. This study also investigated on the different trimming criteria used in MOM. Two robust scale estimators with highest breakdown point, namely Sn and Tn were selected to suit the criteria. The upper control limits for the proposed robust charts were calculated based on simulated data. The performance of each control chart is based on the false alarm and the probability of outlier's detection. In general, the performance of an alternative robust Hotelling's T2 charts is better than the performance of the traditional Hotelling's T2 chart.

In our proposed work, flowgraph model is recommended to use with saddlepoint approximation to estimate total time required by a RFID reader to complete its authentication task. In real world applications of RFID system, server is required to handle multiple RFID readers at the same time in order to have better coverage area of receiving data. Thus, each RFID reader accessed time to server should be limited to certain of time else it will cause network congestion on server. By knowing actual total time required by a single RFID reader to complete its authentication task with specific number of existence RFID tags, administrator can configure on server when it should terminate verification process and start new authentication event with other RFID readers. This will help server to automatically establish a new communication event with other RFID readers when there is no response from existing RFID reader after certain of time. The data analysis model which we have used to represent each task of authentication process in RFID system is known as semi-Markov model.

Within the contents of this paper, the higher moments of return distributions for companies listed in the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) market have been inspected for the period of January 2005 to December 2009. The mean-variance CAPM model is extended by taking higher moments-Skewness and Kurtosis. Monthly stock returns from 80 non-financial companies, covering ten sectors (Engineering, Food & Allied, Fuel & Power, Textile, Pharmaceuticals, Services & Real Estate, Cement, Tannery, Ceramic and Miscellaneous) are studied in this research. From the empirical analysis, it is observed that the intercept term is significantly different from zero and insignificant relationship between beta and excess returns both in mean-variance CAPM and higher moment CAPM conditions. This means that the market excess returns provide no explanation for the asset rate of return, whether or not third and fourth moments are considered in the regression model. But, when the higher moments are introduced, the adjusted R-square increases 0.037 to 0.257. It is noticed that the risk premium for co-skewness risk is positive for the period 2005-2009, indicating that the co-skewness risk is compensated in the DSE market for the studied period. Also, the co-kurtosis risk is rewarded by the market. Thus, in describing risk-return relationship in emerging markets like Bangladesh stock market, the higher moment CAPM performs comparatively well. © Canadian Center of Science and Education.","Multidisciplinary","Universiti Sains Malaysia","Minden","Malaysia"

The estimation model that used dummy coding seems to produce better results based on the total number of significant coefficients. Hence, WTP calculation in the case of dummy coding is more reliable. Based on the results, the use of dummy coding is preferred in the case where the estimation model does not include intercept.

Self-drive tourism represents a type of tourism where tourists hire or travel by their own vehicle. It only involves a tourist destination which can be linked with a network of roads. Normally, the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and multiple traveling salesman problems (MTSP) method were used in the minimization problem such as determination the shortest time or distance traveled. This paper involved an alternative approach for maximization method which is maximize the attraction scores and tested on tourism data for ten cities in Kedah. A set of priority scores are used to set the attraction score at each city. The classical approach of the orienteering problem was used to determine the optimal travel route. This approach is extended to the team orienteering problem and the two methods were compared. These two models have been solved by using LINGO12.0 software.

Using starter set, the process of listing the permutations becomes easy. However a problem arises when the equivalence starter sets will generate the similar permutation and needed to be discarded. Two new recursive strategies are proposed to generate starter sets without generating equivalence starter sets namely circular and exchange two elements operation. Once the starter sets are obtained, the circular and reverse of circular operation are employed to produce distinct permutation from each starter sets. Computational advantages are presented comparing the results obtained by the new method with two other existing methods. The result indicates that the exchange two elements based strategy is faster than the circular based.

On the one hand, failure to report suspicious transactions is an offence under the laws. On the other hand, if they report the transaction, they may breach their duty of confidentiality to their customer or could be liable for tipping off the suspected customer. More importantly, it can also undermine customers' trust. The purpose of this paper is to look into these issues and analyse them against the background of the Malaysian AML laws. Design&sol;methodology&sol;approachThis paper mainly relies on statutes as its primary sources of information. As such, the relevant Malaysian AML that affect the reporting obligations will be identified and analyzed. It will be necessary to examine not just the provisions of the Malaysian Anti&hyphen;Money Laundering and Anti&hyphen;Terrorism Financing Act, but also its regulations and guidelines which affect banks in detail, as this is the most important legislation for the purpose of this paper. FindingsIt is apparent that the reporting suspicious transactions regime has had a significant impact on the operations of banks in Malaysia. While the regime is based on sound principles, the effectiveness of the regime is still unknown. As such, only time will tell whether the banks will be able to cope sufficiently with the increased AML obligations. Obviously, it is critical at this stage, to establish effective coordination between legislators, regulators and the banking industry, in order to minimize problems faced by the banks and thereby to ensure effective implementation of the regime. Originality&sol;valueThis paper provides an examination of the impact of the reporting suspicious transactions regime on Malaysian banks. It is hoped that the study would provide some insight into this particular area for academics, banks, their legal advisers, practitioners and policy makers, not only in Malaysia but also elsewhere. In view of the international nature of money laundering and banking, there will be significant interest in how the AML laws affect banks operating in Malaysia.","Public Administration, Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all), Law","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

In addition, empirical results associated with Granger causality among economic growth, tourism and exports within the neoclassical framework are inconsistent. The objectives of this study, thus, are to determine: the long-run relationship; the long-run and short-run Granger causality; and the long-run triangular Granger causality between economic growth and tourism receipts corresponding to selected macroeconomic variables such as government tourism expenditure, physical capital, education, health and exports as control variables. The long-run Granger causality in vector error correction model (VECM) shows economic growth, tourism receipts and health complement each other (bidirectional causality), while unidirectional causalities are found between government tourism expenditure, physical capital, education and exports to economic growth. In addition, enhancing physical capital, education, health, exports and government tourism expenditure precede tourism receipts; all these in turn indirectly lead to economic growth, thus witnessing triangular relationships among them.","Development, Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","Faculty of Business and Management","Machang","Malaysia"

Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ an advanced panel threshold regression estimation developed in 1999 by Hansen that will indicate whether there are positive and negative impacts of leverage on firm value. This estimation procedure has the advantage of quantifying the threshold level of debt as compared to the ad hoc classification procedure of splitting the sample. Findings: The results show that debt is only pertinent to the firm value up to a threshold level of 64.33 per cent. Additional debt beyond the threshold level does not add to a firm's value. The appropriate level of debt should be applied, which would thus maximize the firm and stockholders' value. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to look at this issue for Malaysian listed firms. The findings from this paper may provide a critical analysis of the usage of debt in firms' capital structure. An excessive level of debt could lead to a debt overhang situation and insolvency at the microeconomic firm level; this could eventually could cause vulnerability in financial systems and thus lead to the financial catastrophes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

S. Lewis's thoughts on the purpose and process of education and his understanding of supernatural human nature which has been relatively little explored. An introduction about Lewis's career as a college teacher blends into the background of this paper. It is followed by Lewis' argument on the purpose of education which is: To produce a ""good man"" (""human"") who pursues knowledge for the sake of learning and makes the right emotional and behavioural responses, affirming truly objective and universal values (Tao). Intertwined with this argument is the dual reality of the human condition straddling this world and the other one with the latter taking precedence over the former. In order to produce educated men and women, Lewis argues for making the most of literary experiences and liberal studies as a main avenue toward the transformation of the inner self of each student. These literary experiences need to be combined with a healthy dose of the right action and behaviour because deliberate action with a purpose can create a reality in our character through the process of gaining momentum as a real interest or attitude in that direction takes hold. Lastly, some of the implications of these reflections for those who work with the young in schools and in liberal education are drawn out. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Education, Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous), Social Sciences (miscellaneous), Social Sciences (all), Law","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Node placement is a fundamental issue closely related to the coverage and connectivity in sensor networks. Node placement influences the target position, coverage area, and connectivity in sensor networks. In random deployment, sensor nodes are deployed randomly in a non-invasive way. The deployment process may cause issues like coverage holes, overlapping, and connectivity failure. Enhancing coverage and connectivity are important for sensor networks to provide a reliable communication within sensing. Placing many sensor nodes in a WSN application region area is not the best solution due to cost and it results in multiple sensors used. Mobile sensor node is used as an alternative to overcome the random deployment problem. The virtual force based self node deployment is used in the mobility sensor to improve the coverage and connectivity area. Virtual Force Algorithm (VFA) approach using virtual repulsive and attractive forces is used to find the optimal node placement to minimize the problems.

Users can access cloud services and pay only for the usage similar to utilities. Trust computing systems can be employed for identifying the service providers quality in terms of their adherence to the committed in SLAs. Several trust computing mechanisms have been proposed in literature based on various algorithms and functions. Almost all of them are based on a single performance parameter and modify the trust scores monotonously when performance deviations are reported. This paper proposes a trust computing mechanism that statistically validates the attribute monitored before modifying the trust scores. Hence the proposed mechanism is protected from momentary fluctuations in system performances. The experiments conducted show that the trust scores computed using the proposed mechanism are more representative of the long term system performance than the ones that were computed without the validation of the inputs.

This problem can be alleviated by having a mechanism to enable exchange of safety related messages to road users in a timely manner. This has given rise to active research in identifying the best technology. Providing comfort and smooth driving experience is also propelling the need to support vehicular communication. These groups of applications present opposing paradigms whereby safety related messages must be exchanged in real-time and characterized by short bursts of traffic and satisfying these diverse criteria are challenging for wireless communications that is the backbone of vehicular communication. Additionally, vehicular nodes sometimes move at high speeds, presenting an added dimension to the complexities surrounding vehicular communication. This article attempts to show the many myriad wireless technologies that have been tossed about as the solution. Choosing the most suitable candidate has to take into account many aspects.

With the competing priorities of work, home, and school, adult learners everywhere desire a high degree of flexibility and accessibility. The structure of ODL provides learners with the greatest flexibility. It provides control over time, place and pace of education; however, learning at a distance is not without problems. Loss of student motivation due to lack of face-to-face (f2f) contact with tutors, peers and content; high startup costs, and lack of support are all barriers to the success of ODL. One important element of success factor for students attending ODL program is the level of interactivity within the student-tutor-content dyads. This paper looks at the issue of interactivity as reported in this research on students' perspectives and experiences of ODL programs in the northern part of Malaysia. The study supported the widely held belief that a high level of interaction is desirable in ODL environment (Dzakiria, 2008, Dzakiria & Idrus, 2003; Rumble, 2000; Walker, 2002)) and positively affects the learning experiences. Recent technological advancements, allowing an increasing level of interaction between the interactivity dyads have implicated how teaching and learning should be in an ODL environment. This study believes to improve ODL experience, decrease dropout rates and maintain success stories for ODL, tutors and all-important stakeholders in ODL must improve the provision of interaction and interactivity. It is evident from the literature that there is a still research gap on interaction issues in ODL which must be pursued and address to improve the learners' educational experience-for they are the primary clientele of ODL.","Education","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This study is designed to analyze and estimate the portfolio performance of Bangladesh stock market in a CAPM framework. For this study, monthly stock returns from 80 companies for the period of January 2005 to December 2009 are chosen. In order to examine whether the CAPM is satisfied in the portfolio or not, the 80 stocks are arranged in descending order of beta and 10 portfolios are being made of eight stocks in each.

Additionally, we find that greater audit committee independence and longer auditor-client tenure shorten audit delay, and more frequent audit committee meetings and higher misstatements in the preliminary unaudited earnings are associated with a longer audit delay. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting","Othman Yeop Abdullah Graduate School of Business","Kuala Lumpur","Malaysia"

Using the textual analysis method, it examines the interplay and tension that exist within the Islamic faith as it concerns its exoteric and esoteric aspects in the novella entitled The Wedding of Zein and Other Stories. The contention of Salih is that whilst the esoteric aspect of Islam (Sufism) portrays mercy, magnanimity and calmness for the people whose story he tells, the exoteric aspect (Sharī'ah) portrays harshness, sadness and is a constant reminder of death, which stifles their enjoyment of this world. The contrast between these two aspects of Islam, as recanted by Salih, is the basis of analysis in this paper with relation to the everyday reality of Muslims in Africa. Whilst the people love the esoteric aspect of Islam, mainly because of its understanding of their limitations as human beings and its focus on mercy over punishment, they dislike the exoteric aspect because of its aloofness and focus on punishment over mercy. They see the exoteric aspect as a necessary component of their society, which they cannot do without because of its function in some religious rites. Finally, the article opines that the novella of Salih is real in that it applies to many Muslim societies in Africa and amply depicts the daily struggle and tension between Sufism and Sharī'ah.","Cultural Studies, History, Religious Studies","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This study is to investigate relationship of each question of the questionnaire with TQM criteria and give a practical way to overcome the existing problem. In this study, with 50 questions of the EFQM and criteria of TQM, a questionnaire has been created. Then, opinions of 175 assessors dealing with EFQM are gathered about the relationship between the questions of EFQM with any of TQM criteria. The data have been processed using SPSS software and the nearest point of a fuzzy number and Topsis model. The results revealed that amount of relationship between each EFQM's question with TQM criteria isn't same therefore the weight of each question in EFQM's questionnaire is not equal to the rest of questions and TQM criteria. Also assigning equal scores to all questions of EFQM's traditional questionnaire is nonrealistic and consequently, the simplicity additive calculation of assessing performance of organization is also nonrealistic and this is created a deviation to assess properly performance of organization. According to the findings of this study, one should consider the EFQM assessors' point of view regarding the relationship between criteria of the two models in order to improve organization performance assessments.

Society inculcates the norms and taboos with clear-cut identification of the dos and don'ts in relational communication among (and between) Malaysians. Although Malaysians may practice different religious rituals or hold different ideologies, they still pay attention to being appropriate and polite in communication to respect each other's differences, a vital concern for those living in this multicultural country. In no small measure, budi (virtue/politeness) helps govern the rules of communication, but the term is nuanced, carrying with it multiple meanings derived from the cultural context. Traditionally, respect, care for other people's emotion, politeness and language use are among the criteria measuring a budi bahasa (man of culture). But, there are other measures as well.

Routing in MANET is responsible for selecting and forwarding packets along optimal paths. Finding an optimal route is a crucial task in MANET where routes tend to be multi-hop. Many routing protocols have been proposed in literature. However, few of them are efficient when the network is sparse and highly dynamic. Position-based routing and forwarding provides the opportunity for improving the efficiency and performance of the existing MANET routing strategies. This research work presents an extensive overview of geographic forwarding techniques in MANET. In particular, it focuses on the presentation of the basic operation mode of geographic forwarding, which is greedy forwarding.

However, this technique suffers from some shortcomings; especially with respect to object-based image retrieval. In this paper, a new semantic feature extracted from dominant colors (weight for each DC) is proposed. The newly proposed technique helps reduce the effect of image background on image matching decision where an object's colors receive much more focus. In addition, a modification to DC-based similarity measure is also proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed descriptor with the similarity measure modification performs better than the existing descriptor in content-based image retrieval application.

The shrinking velocity and wall temperature are assumed to have specific exponential function forms. The governing equations are first transformed to similarity equations using an appropriate similarity transformation. The resulting equations were then solved numerically using shooting technique involving fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and Newton-Raphson method. The influence of mixed convection/buoyancy parameter λ, suction parameter s and Prandtl number Pr on the flow and heat transfer characteristics is examined and discussed. Numerical results indicate that the presence of buoyancy force would contribute to the existence of triple solutions to the flow and heat transfer for particular value of pertinent parameters. It is different for the non-buoyant flow case i.e. when the buoyancy force is absent, the problem admits only dual solutions. Further, this study also reveals that the features of flow and heat transfer characteristics are significantly affected by buoyancy parameter λ, suction parameter s and Prandtl number Pr. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

First, subsidiaries of foreign transnational corporations (TNCs) are thought to have little or no independent capabilities for technological innovation (Lall 1995; Ostry and Harianto 1995; Guyton 1994). Second, they are often criticized for generating few technological externalities or ""spillovers"" to local firms (Lim and Pang 1991:107-18; Lall 1994; Hamzah and Ismail 1993).

Besides the support provided was insufficient for an effective recovery. There existed many governance-related problems. Overall recovery was at a low figure of 64.8 percent. The occurrence of the natural disaster of this high magnitude leaves a trail of lessons to be learnt by both the government agencies and also the donor community. There was no shortage of either the funds or the commodities, but it was sadly the governance and the sensitivity to the suffering of the people. Design/methodology/approach – The study employed the proven methodologies of a survey of available literature, web sites, and publications to obtain secondary data and information on industry especially the micro and SMEs in areas of disaster damage occurred because of Tsunami. The second methodology of research is in areas of collection of data on industry at national level and categorization for selection of sample size. Interviews formed an important source of information. Interviews were conducted with relevant stakeholders conducting various rehabilitation and re-establishment programmes. Findings – Micro and SMEs are important for economic development of Sri Lanka. These carry a strategic importance to generate employment. As such rehabilitation of industry affected by Tsunami is vital. Tsunami could have been used by the government, development agencies and donors as opportunity for rebuilding on modern lines. The main damage was caused to the plant and machinery. A right expenditure should have been in the direction of procurement of tools, equipment and machinery for the affected units. Unfortunately the help could not be organized to reach the right industry, in right quantity, and right way. Surprisingly, it was not because of shortage of funds. Originality/value – The present case leaves lessons for development agencies, government departments and welfare associations. No such extensive study seems to have carried out.","Business and International Management, Business, Management and Accounting (all)","Birla Institute of Management Technology Greater Noida","Greater Noida","India"

The sterility of degree-based education and the creation of ivory tower intellectuals are not the roles which any university can boast about in present times. Education which resonates with public action is the most important contribution of universities. Thus, every university also has an indirect responsibility to provide and develop its local community, and unfortunately, such contribution to developing community through various sustainable development efforts is often underestimated. The contentious issue is that public universities in Malaysia should play a strategic role in the economic and social development of the country and the regions where they are located. This is because university is an important player in the social system because of its supply of professionals that have universalistic skills which provide a better identification of social and economic responsibilities. This chapter, therefore, attempts to explore Malaysia's public universities' role in helping its surrounding community. Particular attention will be given to strategic innovation programs that help foster the development of the community ICT development. Using stakeholder theory and corporate social responsibility model as a framework of study, the study argues that public universities should move beyond its traditional mission of education and research and instead be more sensitive to and aware of the needs of its local community.","Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all), Business, Management and Accounting (all)","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Meanwhile, construction projects suffer from high fragmentation, large waste, poor productivity, cost and time overruns, and conflicts and disputes for a long time. Though SCM has the potential to alleviate these problems significantly, SCM initiatives in construction have been partial-covering a subset of issues in a limited part of the construction supply chain. This paper presents the findings of a Construction SCM (CSCM) study from the Malaysian construction perspective. The main objectives of this study were to, 1) identify the SCM practices, and 2) explore the level of adoption and practice of these identified SCM practices in the Malaysian construction industry. A mixed-mode approach was adopted through structured questionnaires and interviews with the main construction industry players, namely the contractors, developers, and suppliers, where the gathered data was analysed to accomplish the main objectives.From the study, the results were framed against the Strategic Thrusts as provisioned by the Construction Industry Master Plan (CIMP) as released by the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB). The major issues related to the adoption and practice as discussed by the industry players regarding SCM practices in the Malaysian construction industry revolve around six major areas: human resource management; equipment and technology; collaboration practices; construction materials; green practices; and operating environment.","Building and Construction","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

As more audit firm’s clients use enterprise information systems, it is important for audit firms to adopt audit technologies in auditing. Descriptive statistics results from questionnaire survey on 38 audit firms’ auditors reveal that more than 50% of auditors had never used computer-assisted-audit tools other than electronic spreadsheets. Despite the low adoption, the respondents agreed that audit technology is cost-effective. Low mean ratings were given on other indicators of audit technology adoption i.e. technology compatibility, technology complexity, organization readiness, top management support, employee’s competency, client’s system complexity, competitive pressure, vendors’ and professional accounting bodies’ supports. Results also show that firm size influenced the adoption level. Theoretically, this paper contributes in developing a comprehensive audit technology adoption framework by incorporating client’s system complexity and professional accounting body support that enhances the original TOE framework.","Information Systems","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This book traces the ways in which age-old organizational, political, religious and trade networks between Nusantara, the Malay World, and Central Asia, East Africa and the Middle East have changed in recent years. The book argues that these old links are being revived by new forms of globalization, modernization and knowledge transfer that are developing and implementing non-western models of governance, often in direct reference to Islam. The book goes on to explain how, as Malaysia develops new links with Indian Ocean countries, many of them Muslim countries, a new style trading network is being formed, a network with Islamic characteristics, which echoes Indian Ocean Islamic trading networks of earlier times. Interspersed with interesting methodological insights into the latest network, transnational and spatial theories, the book provides detailed case studies of Malaysia’s and Southeast Asia’s trade and numerous other links with Indonesia, Egypt, Zanzibar, Comoros and Central Asia, and concludes by assessing how Malaysia’s and ASEAN’s new style network is likely to develop and influence wider global networks. Written with a depth of knowledge reflective of the author’s many years of research throughout Asia, this book gives a real insight into how Malaysia’s mentalities, traditions and ways of thinking are being applied to its interactions with its immediate neighbours and the wider world.","Social Sciences (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

However, most promising color descriptors consume massive amounts of computation and storage, which is a serious drawback. One of these promising color techniques in image retrieval is the color correlogram, but the technique also suffers from the aforementioned drawbacks. In this paper, we present two compact representations of the color correlogram. The first representation is the compact-generalized correlogram, which compresses colors and generalizes the distances of the original correlogram descriptor. The second representation is the dominant color-based correlogram, which is also a compact and conceptual correlogram descriptor.

It frequently occurred in an 'ad-hoc' manner with an improper planning and vision. The weaknesses could sometimes contribute to an ineffective transfer or a total failure. As a transfer of a new information technology involves different human and non-human actors, they are surrounded with multifaceted practices and countless interactions. A variety of technological, social and economic issues must be addressed and settled throughout these interactions in order to achieve an effective transfer. As interactions become a major concern in achieving an effective transfer, a research was conducted on a few case studies of IT transfer in Malaysia, with an objective to propose a different approach in guiding for an effective IT transfer. The research was based on an Actor-Network Theory that has a robust framework to explore and analyze human and non-human interactions. As a result, a new methodology, Information Technology Transfer Methodology (ITTM), was developed. The methodology offers three stages, (i) Pre-Technology Transfer and Planning, (ii) Technology Transfer Implementation, and (iii) Post-Technology Transfer.","Business and International Management, Management Information Systems, Management of Technology and Innovation, Information Systems and Management","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

However, there is still uncertainty about whether technology parks are achieving their goals or not and exactly what their impact is on their tenants. This paper attempts to contribute in understanding this issue by focusing specifically on the impact of technology park services on high technology industries. A case study on one of well established technology parks in Malaysia that is Kulim Hi-Tech Park (KHTP) has been conducted. After a series of interviews with the administrator and review on literature, nine evaluation criteria were identified and used to observe the impact of technology park services on the industrial tenants of the technology park. From a survey on theindustrial tenants in KHTP it is found that the technology park has all the nine evaluated criteria. However, these criteria have different categories of impact on the tenants. It can be concluded that the there are still more room to improve in ensuring the competitiveness of the technology park. The results have significant implications for the administrator of the KHTP.","Business and International Management, Management Information Systems, Management of Technology and Innovation, Information Systems and Management","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

In spite of the growing demand for childcare services and their critical role in the development of children, childcare providers have faced a high job turnover rate among the employees and difficulty in retaining the employees for a long period. This happen because the employees are not satisfied with their job, which, in turn, contribute to a high job turnover. It is very important for children to have stability of care through satisfied employees at the childcare centres because it is understood that if the employees of childcare centres are dissatisfied, than it could have a negative impact on children under care as well as the childcares' quality. Thus, if childcare providers want to improve the quality of their childcare centres than the employees' quality must be nurtured first. To nurture this quality we have to first ensure their work and job satisfaction. One of the many factors that contribute to employee job satisfaction is through internal market orientation. Hence, this study will try to understand the employee job satisfaction through internal market orientation.

The findings of this study suggested three main benefits to companies that engage in IFR are attract foreign investors, promote company wider to the public, and provide wider coverage. The findings also revealed that three main benefits to the users who collect financial information of companies via their website are increases timeliness and efficiency in obtaining financial information, makes investment decision process easier and faster, and provides information for company inexpensively. The outcome of the analysis revealed that three main factors that are perceived as important by responding firms to engage in IFR are enhance corporate image, company teller with the technology development, and competitors in the industry. The findings also suggested three factors that inhibit firms from engaging in IFR are need to keep information update to be of use, required expertise from the company, and concern over security of information. Another important result revealed that global reach and mass communication as the most important advantages from financial reporting on the Internet.

This paper seeks to explain the challenges found in the work of justice and to explore justice as defined by the West and by Islam. The findings show that there is stark difference especially in the philosophical aspect in how justice is interpreted and applied from the viewpoint of the West and Islam. Findings also show that Islamic approach to justice is more durable and dynamic as the guidance is deeply entrenched in the divine revelation of the Holy Quran; since no human being has the ability of creating, being by nature, fallible and as such produces excellent impact. The impact of justice in Islam can be seen from the Islamic history itself. Unfortunately, since the world has been dominated by the secular system; divine law has slowly been rejected and has been taken as irrelevant and backdated. The researcher also seeks to show why Muslims fail despite of the existence of rich and forceful Islamic ways. In order to overcome the setback, the researcher proposes some reforms for Muslims to return to its original state of Islam that encourages just and good governance. This finding is important as it can provide insights to the government as tools in combating acts of injustice more consistently and forcefully. As injustice is an endemic and the main reason for the collapse of society, this discussion attempts to show that Islamic idea of justice is actually able to solve all problems no matter how big the scale is.

Nevertheless, the yields from this economic activity are different across geographical regions. Since tourism in Malaysia has become the second largest income contributor of foreign exchange after manufacturing, this study attempts to determine whether tourism (in terms of tourism receipts and government tourism expenditure) is crucial for enhancing economic growth in Malaysia from 1974-2010, given production function framework and exports are the control variables. The empirical analysis will be based on Johansen Cointegration for long run relationship and Error Correction Model (ECM) for short run dynamic. Results of long run relationship show all the variables are statistically significant and positively related to economic growth except exports and government tourism expenditure.

The results of this study provide evidence that, given the cultural differences, the agents and the principals may act differently. The findings indicate that blockholders in Malaysia appear to demand more monitoring costs as their shareholdings increase. This positive relationship may be associated with the demand for more monitoring by minority shareholders as a balance against the power of the majority shareholders in the concentrated business environment in Malaysia and the tighten regulations after 1997/98 financial crisis. Further investigation shows that the institutional and non-institutional block-holders react and demand different level of monitoring costs. The institutional blockholders who are mostly government related institutions appear to demand more monitoring costs as their share ownership increase, while the non-institutional shareholders are associated with less monitoring costs as their shares increase.","Business and International Management, Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all), Strategy and Management","Universiti Putra Malaysia","Serdang","Malaysia"

High speed MNs will be a feature of 4G networks as these networks are capable of supporting MNs that move at a speed of up to 250km/hr. Therefore, a network selection mechanism that takes into account MN's mobility scenario is absolutely necessary.

Furthermore, the unprecedented increase of international reserves among the Asian crisis-hit countries (due to Asian Financial Crisis 1997/98) including Malaysia and the lack of studies on this topic underline the urgency of analyzing this issue. Thus, this paper specifically attempts to shed light on the cost of the joint decision to hold international reserves and external debt after the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The article's main findings are that holding international reserves does confer benefits on the country in terms of lower cost and improves the country's ability to protect itself from sudden shock. The results also suggest that Malaysia should hold international reserves of at least 4.96 months of imports, which is higher than the conventional rule of thumb. However, in its current international reserves position, Malaysia could finance 9.3 months of retained imports, which is too much and far above the optimal level.","Business and International Management, Economics and Econometrics, Political Science and International Relations","Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia","Nilai","Malaysia"

A critical requirement for such applications is the ability to receive data packets in correct order with minimal delay (latency) and loss of data. Most Internet Service Providers (ISP) try to achieve this by adding bandwidth in the form of additional infrastructure (links and routers) and load balancing to meet the continuous Internet traffic growth. For real-time protocols, such upgrades are not exclusively beneficial, however. They tend to increase the number of routers (and hence router queues) a packet has to pass through, and increase the potential for out-of-order delivery of packets. Our paper presents the baseline results of a longitudinal study investigating the effects of such infrastructure changes on international real-time traffic. © 2013 IEEE.","Computer Networks and Communications, Information Systems, Signal Processing","The University of Auckland","Auckland","New Zealand"

The model was categorized into two different types according to having ecological case or not. Categorization has been done to uncover a significance impact of environmental variable on rice. Second, to identify the source of efficiency by tobit analysis which are working behind the rice farm of Bangladesh. At last environmental effects has been identified to see the impact of environmental variable on rice production for Aus, Aman and Boro. Mean efficiency of rice farm in Bangladesh is.6497 and.6582 which have got through two different cases i.e. with and without environmental variable cases respectively.In case of without environmental variable the mean efficiency of Aus, Aman and Boro rice is.4543,.5336 and.9609 respectively.

Although the country has implemented a range of anti-pollution legislation, the problem has not been resolved and companies continue to pollute on a large scale. This makes it important to understand why current environmental legislation is not working and what must be done to improve the situation. Studies on compliance with environmental regulations are not only important for protecting the environment and ecosystem, but also provide credibility to enforcement agencies about its regulatory programs. An econometric model was used to estimate the violation decision of company owners and managers of food, textile and paper industry in Penang, Kedah and Perlis. The study finds that, although the legislation has been successful in raising environmental awareness among businesses, it has been less successful at reducing effluent pollution. The study shows that many company owners and managers have an adequate knowledge of environmental protection. It is also clear that companies do not consider environmental protection as a top priority. Overall, cost of effluent treatment and the probability of detection can influence compliance behaviour of companies with regard to environmental regulations. The study makes a number of suggestions for improving the effectiveness of environmental legislations. Recommendations include increasing tax incentives for effluent treatment equipment andfrequency in enforcement activity to motivate business firms to comply with environmental regulations.","Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","Universiti Malaysia Terengganu","Kuala Terengganu","Malaysia"

The questionnaire comprised 40 items and has high reliability with Cronbach Alpha 0.94. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and Multiple Regression Analysis. Findings: The findings showed that principals' support in decision making was at a high level while the level of teachers' commitment in decision-making was at moderate level. The regression analysis showed that teacher's attitudes had significant relationship with loyalty and willingness to remain in school. The findings also indicate that principals' support partially mediated the effect of teachers' attitude and loyalty, and willingness to remain in decision making. Significance: This study illustrates that teachers who have a positive attitude while engaged in decision-making in high performance schools will remain at the school.

This paper highlights the application of simple weighted average (SWA) as an alternative method in aggregating students' academic achievements. The weights of the academic subjects must be determined prior to the use of SWA. Methodology: In a case study, a group of five teachers from one primary school was asked to rate five main subjects taught in primary schools according to their importance. These five teachers have taught the five subjects for more than six years. The obtained weights values were used to re-compute 2011 mid-semester final examination scores of 33 year-six pupils at the selected primary school. Findings: The teachers decided to give different weight to three subjects, but same weights to two subjects. Furthermore, the SWA scores give different ranking to the pupils as compared to the SA scores. Another sentence or two needed here to explain the findings. Significance: It is argued that the use of the SWA method is more suitable than the simple average method in finding the overall scores of students' achievements. The SWA method considers the subjects to have different degrees of importance, as they do in the actual educational context.","Cultural Studies, Education, Psychology (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

In this paper, we specifically focus on the students' reflections of their online experience of talking around academic texts. Method: The qualitative data used in this paper were derived from students' reflective diaries, students' FB interactions, and informal conversations and were collected from a group of students (27) attending a master's class in distance learning mode. Thematic analysis was conducted to examine the themes that emerged to represent their reflections. Findings: The students' reflections were grouped into two major categories: convenience and facilitation of learning. Students' reflection on the convenience afforded by the FB talk centered mainly on the idea of distance and time. Their reflections on the facilitation of learning were broken down into the following themes: safe environment to explore, social support, self-regulation and autonomy. A separate category, ""FB entries need responding"", was assigned to students' comments about the importance of lecturer's and group members' feedback. Value: This study revealed the potential of FB as a convenient, safe and an informal avenue for students to share their understandings and reading-related problems.

However, in real life this perfect situation is rarely encountered. When the problem of nonnormality and variance heterogeneity simultaneously arise, rates of Type 1 error are usually inflated resulting in spurious rejection of null hypotheses. In addition, the classical least squares estimators can be highly inefficient when assumptions of normality are not fulfilled. The effect of non-normality on the trimmed F statistic was demonstrated in this study. We propose the modifications of the trimmed F statistic mentioned by using (1) a priori determined 15% symmetric trimming and (2) empirically determined trimming using robust scale estimators such as MADn, Tn and LMSn. The later trimming method will trim extreme values without prior trimming percentage. Based on the rates of Type I error, the procedures were then compared. Data from g- and h- distributions were considered in this study. We found the trimmed F statistic using robust scale estimator LMSn as trimming criterion provided good control of Type I error compared to the other methods.

Diclofenac-loaded liposomes were prepared using the proliposome method. The anti-inflammatory effects of nanoencapsulated and free diclofenac were evaluated using the carrageenan-induced paw edema, formalin-induced paw licking and cotton-pellet-induced granuloma tests in vivo. For carrageenan-induced paw edema, 2 and 20 mg/kg liposome-encapsulated diclofenac showed significant paw volume reduction compared to free form diclofenac of equivalent dosage groups. In the formalin test, significant reduction in paw-licking time was observed in late phase for both liposome-encapsulated and free-form diclofenac (2 and 20 mg/kg) with the percentage of inhibition of 28.62, 60.17% for free-form diclofenac and 31.45, 78.84% for liposome-encapsulated diclofenac, respectively. In cotton-pellet-induced granuloma test 20 mg/kg free-form diclofenac showed significant reduction in the size of granuloma in both transudative and granuloma weight with percentage of inhibition of 42.93 and 49.26%, respectively, when compared to controls. Interestingly, 20 mg/kg nanoencapsulated diclofenac showed a larger reduction of the parameter with percentage of inhibition of 48.43 and 63.55%, respectively. Collectively, these results indicated that nanoencapsulated diclofenac exhibited statistically higher efficacy than free-form diclofenac when orally administered. Hence, clinical dosage may be reduced thereby reducing the drug's adverse effects.

Due to the high demand, thus spectrum has become scarce. As a result, spectrum bandwidths have become important and need to be effi ciently assigned to potential and demanding service providers. Thus, this paper proposes an integrated approach to solve a spectrum assignment problem. The integrated model is developed to effi ciently determine the optimal spectrum assignment for the purpose of satisfying the identifi ed relevant requirements and constraints or criteria. The development of the model has also taken into consideration the situation when the spectrum regulator wishes to choose the best provider or licensee based on merits. For that purpose, suitable weights based on qualitative criteria were obtained via Analytic Hierarchy Process and subsequently used as coeffi cients in the respective Integer Programming formulation. The integrated optimization model is able to tackle a multi-criteria spectrum problem and then solve the assignment problem by way of maximizing the total effi ciency. The results exhibits a more effi cient alternative as compared to the existing qualitative approach, as it is able to combine subjective judgments computation with a mathematically formulated approach to produce a systematic and consistent results.","Computer Science (all), Mathematics (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Zakat institutions are trusted bodies that manage zakat in Muslim countries. In Malaysia, such zakat institutions are State Islamic Religious Councils (SIRCs). The institutions are expected to play a key role in promoting the socio-economic objectives of zakat in Malaysia. Thus, it is of prime importance that these institutions are being managed efficiently. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the efficiency of zakat institutions in Malaysia. This study uses the Malmquist Productivity Index to estimate productivity and efficiency of zakat institutions in Malaysia and the Tobit model to determine the factors affecting efficiency of zakat institutions in Malaysia. The data consists of a panel of fourteen zakat institutions in Malaysia during the period of 2003 to 2007. Our results suggest that Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of zakat institutions in Malaysia increased at an average rate of 2.4 per cent during the study period and is mainly attributed to technical progress rather than efficiency components. The empirical findings based on the Tobit regression suggest that zakat payment system, computerised zakat system, board size, audit committee and decentralisation significantly affect the efficiency of zakat institutions in Malaysia.","Business and International Management, Accounting","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Under the system, board appointments are usually controlled by the firm's substantial shareholders, and as a result, directors are chosen based on ""the old-boy"" network or ""people like us"", who are typically middle-aged males and from similar ethnicity which could lead to ""group think"". Board diversity ensures breadth and depth of the board's judgments. To this end, this study examines board diversity of the top 100 non-financial Malaysian firms, specifically directors' gender, ethnicity and age and their effects on firm performance. Data are collected from the 2007 annual reports of the sample firms. The evidence indicates the lack of diversity of the Malaysian boards of directors. Results from the multivariate analyses reveal that gender diversity is negatively associated with Tobin's q and ROA. Age diversity is found to be negatively related to ROA. Ethnic diversity, on the other hand, is found to be positively associated with ROA. Hence, findings on the effect of board diversity and firm performance are mixed. Nevertheless, this study offers insights to policy makers in enhancing corporate governance in Malaysia where diversity is one of the areas that could strengthen the effectiveness of the board.","Business and International Management, Accounting, Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","International Islamic University Malaysia","Kuala Lumpur","Malaysia"

The contracts include Bay 'Bithaman Ajil (BBA), Murabahah, Musharakah Mutanaqisah, and Istisna'. More than 10 banks still use the BBA contract while others begin to focus on the use of equity-based financing contracts such as Musharakah Mutanaqisah. In Malaysia, sales of a house can take place even before the house is built or when it is still under construction. Therefore, Islamic home financing products must be offered through an appropriate contract to ensure they encompass fair and compassionate elements consistent with the Islamic rules. Selection of a proper contract is crucial to circumvent the stigma that Islamic banking is unjust in cases of abandoned houses. Hence, this article tries to see how this problem is addressed specifically in four Islamic products; Bay 'Bithaman Ajil (BBA), Murabahah, Musharakah Mutanaqisah, and Istisna'. In its analysis, this study applies three methods; inductive, deductive and comparative methods. The results show that certain contracts are better than others in protecting customers from directly assuming the burden in cases of abandoned houses.","Business and International Management, Accounting, Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

To increase resource availability and to ease resource sharing in such environment, there is a need for replication services. Data replication is one of the methods used to improve the performance of data access in distributed systems by replicating multiple copies of data files in the distributed sites. Replica placement mechanism is the process of identifying where to place copies of replicated data files in a Grid system. Existing work identifies the suitable sites based on number of requests and read cost of the required file. Such approaches consume large bandwidth and increases the computational time. The authors propose a replica placement strategy (RPS) that finds the best locations to store replicas based on four criteria, namely, 1) Read Cost, 2) File Transfer Time, 3) Sites' Workload, and 4) Replication Sites. OptorSim is used to evaluate the performance of this replica placement strategy. The simulation results show that RPS requires less execution time and consumes less network usage compared to existing approaches of Simple Optimizer and LFU (Least Frequently Used).

Managers always tried to design effective business to meet customer demands better than competitors. So, understanding the main issues related to supply chain management (SCM) implementation can help managers to make an effective strategy in managing their customers' demands and fulfilling suppliers' requirements. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the important problematic issues which hinder companies to implement SCM. To achieve these goals implementing SCM in two important industries in Malaysia (automotive and food) have been considered. A questionnaire was used to identify the perceived problems and attitudes towards SCM. The questionnaire was distributed to 600 food and automotive organisations in Malaysia. A total of 62 usable replies were received from the automotive industry, and 140 from the food organisations. Structured interviews were used to find out how problematic issues in these organisations could be overcome. The key problems were identified as: a lack of information (automotive industry) and high costs (food industry). Benchmarking from experienced companies and conducting training courses were identified as important methods to reduce these problems.

As a result of a continuous increase in crude oil price at international levels, the burden of fuel subsidy on the government has become bigger. Thus, the government tries to reduce fuel subsidy gradually. The immediate impact of a reduction in fuel subsidy is an increase in the price of fuel at the retail level. Then, there is a chain effect of an increase in price of fuel to the price of other goods and services. The end result is a decrease in purchasing power of the general consumer. To overcome this problem, the government introduces a direct transfer of payment to poor households, but this compensation is too small to counter the increase in the general price level. At the same time, it is found that this program has a negative impact on macro-economic performance and an increase in poverty, income disparity, and the depth of poverty. As an alternative to the direct cash aid to poor households, the government may transfer fuel subsidy to the agricultural sector. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of the diversion of fuel subsidy to the non-food crops in the agricultural sector on income and the poverty in Indonesia. This study employs a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. The Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) index is used to measure various poverty indicators, such as head count, poverty gap and poverty severity indices. The households are classified into four categories; urban non-poor, urban poor, rural non-poor, and rural poor.

It is no coincidence that previous Malaysian premiers have actively promoted such system. Leading the way is Mahathir Mohamad, the country's fourth Prime Minister, who was a vocal advocate of ""Asian values, "" followed by his successor, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who championed the idea of Islam Hadhari. These two sets of values are not entirely incompatible to each other but rather share some similarities. The concepts of ""Asian values"" and Islam Hadhari are premised on several fundamental tenets, which include: promoting Islamic values, championing the Malay agenda, protecting cultural values, and challenging Western cultural imperialism. Their origin can be traced from the aggressive attempt by the ruling power - the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) - Barisan Nasional (BN) to strengthen and consolidate the political supremacy of the alliance. Inevitably, both of these value systems have been subjected to many criticisms, predominantly under the pretext of misguided and ill-properly constructed values by the ruling regime to justify its autocratic rule. The very nature of such value systems has often triggered political debates in terms of defining Malaysia as a nation. The espoused agenda of Islamisation and possibly assimilation have stirred profound uneasiness among the country's significantly large population of non-Muslims. The value system brought by ""Asian values"" and Islam Hadhari can lead to one understanding of Mahathir's and Abdullah's leadership and administration in governing Islam and politics in Malaysia.","Cultural Studies, Philosophy","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

However, the study is limited to the analysis of land tax. The results indicate that state governments differ significantly in terms of their tax capacity, as well as their tax effort. The states of Pahang, Perak and Terengganu are found to have above average land tax capacity. However, these states do not seem to be able to leverage on their capacity as demonstrated by the level attained in relation to the tax effort index. The relationship between tax effort and fiscal position is also examined to determine whether fiscal deficit or surplus is influenced by the level of tax effort exerted. The results sufficiently demonstrate that states with higher tax effort have lower deficit or higher surplus as compared to states with lower tax effort.","Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

One solution for investigating the effect of the SQ option is through the inclusion of the alternative specific constant (ASC) in an estimation model. However, the solution is not applicable for an estimation model that has no ASC. In the present study, the heteroscedastic extreme value (HEV) model is applied to investigate the affect of the SQ effect on preference uncertainty.

As an integrated system, the efficiency of emergency department depends on its interaction between inter-departmental units and intra-departmental elements. Over the years, with the rapid development of computer technology, there has been a rising trend of using simulation modeling to improve healthcare operations. Discrete-event simulation (DES) has become a popular and effective decision-making tool for modeling the stochastic operational activities in a system. However for a whole system approach, system dynamics (SD) has advantages over DES. SD does not require vast data and is able to capture the interdependency relations between different units in an integrated system. Both approaches have strengths and weaknesses that may support and complement each other. An integrated model of both approaches will provide a realistic view of a complex system.

This is to ensure that competent graduates are produced from HEIs. Undoubtedly, the Iraq post-wars and economic sanctions have led to poor states of technology and education in the country. As part of the Iraqi accounting education, accounting information system (AIS) course content has been affected by the Iraqi circumstances, since the global trend demands a technologydriven course. This results in Iraq lagging behind compared to other countries, even amongst developing countries. Thus, there is a need to determine the factors that need to be considered while developing an AIS course in Iraq in order to make it at on par with international standards.

Studies show that conventional numerical method such as multistep method fail woefully near the singular point when solving problem whose solution possesses singularity. This is because a multistep method is based on the local representation of polynomial of the theoretical solution of an initial value problem. Therefore, a natural step would appear to be the replacement of the polynomial function for a multistep method, by a rational function due to its smooth behaviour in the neighbourhood of singularity. In this paper, we have developed a new class of twostep numerical methods that are based on rational functions in solving general initial value problem and problem whose solution possesses singularity. These new methods are called rational multistep methods. The developments of these rational multistep methods, as well as the local truncation error and stability analysis for each rational multistep method are presented. We have found out that only the second order, third order and fourth order rational multistep methods are A-stable.

It appeared that the time series data for pigeon pea, chickpea and field pea were 1st order homogenous stationary. Two types of models namely Box-Jenkins type Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and deterministic type growth models, are examined to identify the best forecasting models for pigeon pea, chickpea and field pea pulse production in Bangladesh. The study revealed that the best models were ARIMA (1, 1 and 1), ARIMA (0, 1 and 0) and ARIMA (1, 1 and 3) for pigeon pea, chickpea and field pea pulse production, respectively. Among the deterministic type growth models, the cubic model is best for pigeon pea, chickpea and field pea pulse production. The analysis indicated that short-term forecasts were more efficient for ARIMA models compared to the deterministic models. The production uncertainty of pulse could be minimized if production were forecasted well and necessary steps were taken against losses.

Questionnaires were sent to top management personnel of firms in four manufacturing sectors namely electrical and electronics, chemicals (including petroleum), food and beverages and fabricated metal. The results confirmed that the make or buy sourcing strategy acts as mediators and it partially does so on the relationship between related product diversification strategy and organisational performance. In addition, the buy strategy mediated partially the relationship between unrelated product diversification strategy and organisational performance. These findings go along with the theories that support both constructs, Industrial Organisation (IO) Theory, Transaction Cost Theory and Resource-Based View (RBV).

We proposed the strategy to estimate the zakat and employed a multivariate regression to analyse a panel macroeconomic data of 19 Moslem countries for the period 2004-2010. The empirical results give some evidence that zakat is able to become a powerful resource of economic growth, or in other words, it could be domestic direct investment that provides source of fund to the country development. Although the proposed model is limited due to the availability of complete panel macroeconomic data, we conclude that zakat will become a serious implementable economic growth policy in Moslem countries reflecting a self-sufficient spirit, equitable distribution of wealth paradigm, and much more human-touch in managing national development.

VoIP offers high-rate voice services at low cost with good flexibility, typically in a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). In a voice conversation, each client works either as a sender or a receiver depending on the direction of traffic flow over the network. A VoIP technologically requires high throughput, less packet loss and a high fairness index over the network. The packets of VoIP streaming may experience drops because of competition among the different kinds of traffic flow over the network. A VoIP application is also sensitive to delays and requires voice packets to arrive on time from the sender to the receiver without any delay over a WLAN. To date, scheduling of VoIP traffic is still an unresolved problem. The objectives of this survey paper are to discuss fundamental principles of VoIP-related schedulers and identify current scheduler issues.

In this article, we focus on two of the key issues addressed in Chapter 1: stewardship and the definition of the primary user groups of financial statements. To address the discourses surrounding the evolution of Chapter 1, we introduce the concept of ""living law"" from sociological jurisprudence into accounting scholarship. We first trace the role of stewardship/accountability in the evolution-from antiquity to the present day-of the living law of accounting. We then explore the origin, nature, and implications-from a living law perspective-of the moral traditions associated with stewardship/accountability. Our analysis suggests that stewardship has been, and continues to be, embedded in the living law of accounting-notwithstanding the formal pronouncements of standard setters. We also examine the social accounting project from a living law perspective and we suggest that such an analysis provides new possibilities for addressing core social accounting concerns. We conclude by arguing that, particularly in light of the far reaching impact of the neoliberal agenda, there is an urgent need for scholars in both contemporary ""social"" and ""mainstream"" accounting to recognize and build upon their shared living law heritage rooted in the age-old traditions of stewardship/accountability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting, Sociology and Political Science, Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management, Information Systems and Management","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The governing system of partial differential equations is reduced to ordinary differential equations by assuming that the surface temperature of the cylinder and the velocity of the external (inviscid) flow vary linearly with the axial distance x measured from the leading edge. Solutions of the resulting ordinary differential equations for the flow and heat transfer characteristics are evaluated numerically for various values of the governing parameters, namely the nanoparticle volume fraction φ, the mixed convection or buoyancy parameter λ and the curvature parameter γ. Results are presented for the specific case of copper nanoparticles. A critical value λc of λ with λc < 0 is found, with the values of {pipe}λc{pipe} increasing as the curvature parameter γ or nanoparticle volume fraction φ is increased. Dual solutions are seen for all values of λ > λc for both aiding, λ > 0 and opposing, λ < 0, flows. Asymptotic solutions are also determined for both the free convection limit (λ ≫ 1) and for large curvature parameter (γ ≫ 1). © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Catalysis, Chemical Engineering (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"
